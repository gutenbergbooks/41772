<h1 title="">THE SILENT ALARM</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE PRISONER IN A LONE CABIN</h2>
<p>In a cabin far up the side of Pine Mountain,
within ten paces of the murmuring waters of
Ages Creek, there stood an old, two roomed
log cabin. In one room of that cabin sat a
girl. She was a large, strong girl, with the
glow of ruddy health on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Her dress, though simple, displayed a taste
too often missing in the Cumberland Mountains
of Kentucky, and one might have
guessed that she was from outside the mountains.</p>
<p>If one were to observe her, sitting there in
a rustic splint bottomed chair; if he were to
study her by the flickering firelight, he might
have said: &ldquo;She is a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>In this he would have been wrong. Florence
Huyler was virtually a prisoner in that
cabin. As she sat there dreamily gazing at
the flickering fire, a man did sentry duty outside
the door. He seemed asleep as he sat
slouched over in a chair tilted against the
cabin, but he was not. Nor would the occupant
of that chair sleep this night.</p>
<p>Yet, had you said to Florence, &ldquo;Why do
they hold you prisoner here?&rdquo; she would have
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would have been true, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they want?&rdquo; she asked herself
for the thousandth time as she sat there watching
the coals of her wood fire blink out one by
one. &ldquo;Are they moonshiners? Do they think
I am a secret agent of the revenue men? Do
they want this,&rdquo; she patted a pocket inside
her blouse, &ldquo;or have they been hired by the
big coal company to hold me until the secret
of the railroad is out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>When she patted her blouse there had come
a crinkling sound. Ten new fifty dollar bank
notes were pinned to the inside of the garment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what they want,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t they demand it and let me
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered as she rose. The room was
cold. She dreaded facing a night in that
cabin.</p>
<p>Having entered the second room, she closed
the door softly behind her, then sat down
upon the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>After removing her shoes, she glanced up
at the smoke blackened ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hole up there,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I wonder
if.... No, I guess not. Never can tell,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once her lithe body was in motion.
With the agility of a cat, she sprang upon a
chair, mounted its back, caught the edge of
the opening above and drew herself up into
the attic, then dropped noiselessly down
upon a beam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Dusty,&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>Five minutes later she found herself staring
out into the moonlight. At the upper
end of the cabin loft she had found a small
door that opened to a view of the mountain
side. Having found this she opened it noiselessly.
It would be an easy matter to hang
by her hands, drop to the ground and then
attempt her escape through the brush. This
she was about to do when something arrested
her&mdash;a very small thing. On a narrow level
space where the grass had been eaten short
by cows or wild creatures, three young rabbits
were sporting in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame to spoil their fun,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;Time enough.&rdquo; She seated herself
close to the opening.</p>
<p>A moment later she was thankful for the
impulse that caused her to wait. In an instant,
without a sound, the rabbits disappeared
into the brush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>With a little gasp the girl closed the small
door. Ten seconds later, by peering through
a crack, she saw a man cross the small clearing.
It was her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, little rabbits,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;You did me a good turn that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the man returned across
the patch of short grass and once more the
girl set herself to listening and watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the little gray fellows come back
to play, I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>As she sat there waiting, feeling the cool
caress of the mountain night air upon her
cheek, listening, watching, she allowed her
eyes to wander away to the half dozen little
peaks that formed the crest of Pine Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dark and mysterious they seem in
the night,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her meditations were suddenly cut short.
Her eyes had caught a yellow gleam that had
suddenly appeared on the very crest of the
highest peak of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what can it mean?&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&mdash;but it is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Even as she looked, the yellow gleam
blinked out for a second, glowed again, only
to vanish, then to glow steadily once more.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart grew warm, her cheeks
flushed. Whereas only the moment before
she had felt herself utterly alone in an unknown
and hostile world, now she knew that
on the crest of yonder mountain there stood
a friend, her very best friend, Marion Norton.
Between her and that peak lay many
a long and tangled trail. What of that?
That golden glow spoke warmly of friendship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Silent Alarm,&rdquo; she murmured as she
hastily drew from her pocket two dark cylinders.
One of the cylinders she placed before
her on the window ledge. The other
she grasped at either end, drawing it out to
four times its original length. The thing was
a pocket telescope such as is often carried in
the mountains. From the ends of this she
unscrewed the lenses. After that, lying flat
upon the dusty floor that was all but level
with the sill of the small shuttered door, she
glanced along the tube of the dismantled
telescope. Slowly, surely, as if the thing
were a rifle, she aimed it at the distant yellow
gleam. Then, without allowing the tube
to move, she picked up the other shorter one
which had all this time rested on the window
sill. Having placed the end of this against
the end of the hollow tube, she pressed a
button, and at once a needle point of glowing
light shot forth into the night. The second
cylinder was a small but powerful flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Silent Alarm,&rdquo; she whispered once
more.</p>
<p>She had kept the small flashlight aimed at
the distant yellow flash of fire less than a
moment when, with a suddenness that was
startling, the glow on the distant mountain
crest vanished. It was as if someone had
thrown a shovel of earth or a bucket of
water upon a small camp fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>The little tableau was not at an end. Florence,
by moving her hand before her tube,
sent out successive flashes, some short, some
long. Now a short one, now two long ones,
now three short; so it went on for some
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Silent Alarm,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I only
hope she gets it right. She might try to
come to me. That would be too terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had scarcely passed her mind when,
of a sudden, from that same distant hillside
there gleamed a star. Or was it a star?
If a star, then a tree branch must wave before
it, for now it appeared, only to disappear and
reappear again.</p>
<p>It was no star. At once, with a pencil and
a scrap of paper, the girl was marking down
dots and dashes, taking the message being
sent by signal code from the distant mountain
crest.</p>
<p>As she scratched down the last dash, the
star vanished, not to reappear. Once more
darkness brooded over the foothills of Pine
Mountain and the somber peaks beyond were
lost in the glooms of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>For a time, by the steady gleam of her
flashlight, the girl studied her dots and
dashes. Then, as she closed her tired eyes
for a moment, she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I had hoped for a real message, a
message that would mean success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she opened her eyes she glanced down
to the spot of golden moonlight on the grass.
The rabbits had returned to complete their
frolic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to try it,&rdquo; she whispered as she
drew herself up on her knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />STRANGE SENTRIES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, jolly little friends,&rdquo; she whispered
to the rabbits. &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you,
but it really has to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clutching at her heart in a vain effort to
still its wild beating, she slid slowly out of
the window. A gripping of the beams, a
swinging down, a second of clinging, a sudden
drop, a prayer of thanksgiving that her
alighting place was grass cushioned and
noiseless, and the next instant she was lost
from sight in the brush whither the three
rabbits had fled.</p>
<p>For a full moment she crouched there motionless,
scarcely breathing, listening intently.</p>
<p>There came no sound. Her guard was dozing
in his chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Her mind was in a whirl. Now that she
was free, where should she go? Where could
she go? Home, if she could find the way, or
to Everett Faucet&rsquo;s cabin. Everett lived at
the back of the mountain.</p>
<p>Yes, she might go to either place if only
she knew the way. Truth was, she didn&rsquo;t
know the way. She had been carried about
on horseback by her mysterious captors, covering
strange trails, and at night. She was
lost. Only one thing she knew&mdash;she was still
on the back of Pine Mountain. The way
home led up this side of the mountain and
down the other.</p>
<p>A great wave of fear and despair swept
over her. The whole affair, she told herself,
was a useless adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back home to our cabin; give it
up,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>She began the upward climb. Beating her
way through the brush, she struggled forward.
It was heart-breaking work, making
her way through brush and timber. Here a
dense thicket tore at her, and there a solid
wall of rock blocked her progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to find a trail. Have to,&rdquo; she
panted.</p>
<p>With this in mind, she began to circle the
slope. She felt the need of haste. Night was
wearing away. The early morning would
soon reveal her, a lone girl in a strange and
apparently hostile country.</p>
<p>Panic seized her. She fairly flew through
the brush until, with a sudden compact that
set her reeling, she came upon a rail fence.</p>
<p>Beyond the fence was a narrow trail. To
her immense relief she found that this trail
wound away up the mountain.</p>
<p>That mountain trail was the longest she
had ever taken. It wound on and on, up and
up until there seemed no end.</p>
<p>The cool damp of night hung over everything.
The moon, swinging low in the heavens,
cast long, deep shadows far down the
trail. Now a startled rabbit, springing into
the brush, sent the girl&rsquo;s heart to her mouth.
Now the long-drawn bay of a hound at some
distant cabin sent a chill running up her
spine. Frightened, alone, quite without means
of protection, she hurried on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Then suddenly, as she rounded a corner,
she caught the sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; she said to herself with a shudder.</p>
<p>The next instant she was silently pushing
herself back into the depths of a clump of
mountain ivy that grew beside the trail.</p>
<p>The men were coming down the trail. Now
their voices sounded more clearly; now she
caught the shuffle of their rough shoes, and
now heard the heavy breathing of one as if
carrying a load.</p>
<p>As they came abreast of her, she saw them
dimly through the leaves. Then for a second
her heart seemed to stop beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dog,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;A long-eared
hound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hound, with nose to the ground,
came upon the spot where she had left the
trail, he stopped short, gave a loud snort,
then started straight into the bush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you!&rdquo; one of the men grumbled,
seizing him by the collar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog struggled for a time, but a kick
brought him back to his place behind his
master and they traveled on down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; the girl breathed as she dropped
weakly upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought as strength and
courage came back to her, &ldquo;why should I
fear everyone here behind Pine Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why indeed? The experiences of the past
hours had made fear a part of her nature.</p>
<p>Once more upon the trail, she hurried on
more rapidly than before. Dawn was on its
way. The jagged peaks of the mountain
ahead showed faintly gray against the dark
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to hurry,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Have
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke short off and once
more she sprang from the trail. Other men
were coming. The night seemed filled with
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>This time, finding herself in a narrow grass
grown trail that led away at an angle from
the hard beaten main trail, she hurriedly tiptoed
along it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another narrow escape like the last
one,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>She had followed this apparently deserted
trail for a hundred yards when suddenly she
came upon a cabin.</p>
<p>Her first thought was to turn and flee. A
second look told her that the place was abandoned.
Two panes of glass in the single window
were broken and before the door, displaying
their last fiery red blossoms, two
hollyhocks did sentry duty.</p>
<p>The door stood ajar. For a moment she
hesitated before the red sentries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; she whispered at last. &ldquo;You
dear old-fashioned guardians of a once happy
home, I can pass you without cracking a stem
or bruising a blossom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Putting out her hands, she parted the tall
flowers with gentlest care, then stepped between
them. For this simple ceremony, inspired
by her love of beauty, she was destined
in not so many hours to feel supremely
grateful.</p>
<p>Inside she found a lonesome scene. The
moon, shining through the single window,
struck across a rude table. A dark cavern
at the end spoke of a fireplace which once
had offered ruddy comfort.</p>
<p>A ladder leading to the loft stood against
the wall. Without thinking much about it,
she climbed that ladder. Somewhat to her
surprise, she found the attic half filled with
clean, dry, rustling corn husks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone stowed his corn here. Husked
the corn and left the husks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how comfortable,&rdquo; she sighed as
her weary body relaxed upon this springy
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest here for a moment,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;rest here for a&mdash;for a&mdash;rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment she was fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Hours later she awoke with a start. She
sat up and rubbed her eyes. Then, catching
the rustle of corn husks, she remembered
where she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have fallen asleep,&rdquo; she said, a feeling
of consternation coming over her. &ldquo;And
now it is&mdash;&rdquo; She gazed about her questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is daylight,&rdquo; she finished as she
noted a bright bar of sunlight that fell across
the floor. &ldquo;Here I stay until dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she remained. Once she left the
cabin for a moment to slake her thirst at a
spring that bubbled out of the rocks just back
of the house. Both in coming and going she
reverently parted the hollyhocks before the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some childish hands spilled the
seed that started them growing there,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;I wonder where that child may
be now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attic was silent, too silent. In one
dark corner a fly, caught in a spider&rsquo;s web,
slowly buzzed his life away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>There was time now for thinking. And
she did think, thought this whole adventure
through from its very beginning.</p>
<p>It is strange, the unusual opportunities for
adventure and romance that come to one in
out-of-the-way places. Florence, with her
chum, Marion, had been invited by Mrs.
McAlpin, Florence&rsquo;s aunt, to spend the summer
in the mountains. They had come, expecting
fishing, swimming and mountain
climbing. They had found time for these,
too; but above all, their summer had been
filled with service, service for those whose
opportunities had been far fewer than their
own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The one great service they had been able
to render had been that of conducting a summer
school for the barefooted, eager little
children who swarmed the sides of Big Black
Mountain. It had been a real pleasure to
teach them. Strange to say, though there
was a public school at the mouth of Laurel
Branch, little was ever taught in it. The
teacher, who knew nothing of grammar, geography
or history, and little enough of
&ldquo;Readin&rsquo;, &rsquo;Ritin&rsquo; and &rsquo;Rithmatic,&rdquo; took the
school for no purpose save that he might
draw the public money. The school, which
was supposed to last six months, he brought
to an end as speedily as possible. If no children
came he could go back to his farm work
of putting away his corn crop or rolling logs
to clear land for next year&rsquo;s harvest, and he
could do this and still draw his pay as a
teacher.</p>
<p>The schoolhouse, a great log shack with
holes for doors and windows, was without
either doors or windows to keep out the
weather. Before the cold autumn rains the
little group of children who came to drone
out words after their disinterested teacher
vanished like blackbirds before the first snow,
leaving the teacher free for other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Now all was to be changed&mdash;at least the
girls hoped so. They had been teaching the
summer school for six weeks when Ransom
Turner, a sincere and ambitious man who had
the good of the community at heart, had
come to them proposing that they remain
through autumn and early winter and teach
the public school.</p>
<p>Here was an opportunity to make a real
contribution, to set a model for all time, to
give these simple mountain folks an idea of
what school should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Ransom Turner had said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to elect you a trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trustee!&rdquo; they had exclaimed in unison,
failing to understand his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You don&rsquo;t think that worthless
scamp that&rsquo;s been drawin&rsquo; the pay and
not teachin&rsquo; any could get the job unless he&rsquo;d
elected a trustee, do you? But leave that to
us mounting folks. You jest say you&rsquo;ll take
the school an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll elect you a trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the schoolhouse!&rdquo; Florence had remonstrated.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough now&mdash;flies,
and all that&mdash;but in cold weather it would be
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Ransom&rsquo;s face had clouded. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be
helped none, I reckon. They hain&rsquo;t no funds
fer hit. Doors and windows cost a heap,
havin&rsquo; to be brought in as they do. Us
mounting folks are most terrible poor, most
terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls had considered the proposition
seriously. They were not yet through
the University. It seemed a little hard to
give up the first half of their school year.
They caught visions of great buildings,
swarming students, laughing faces, books,
libraries, all the good things that go to make
University life a joyous affair. Yet here was
an opportunity for an unusual service. Could
they afford to refuse? They had talked it
over. In the end Florence had said to Ransom:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can manage the trustee and we
can get some money to fix up the schoolhouse,
we will stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Marion had given hearty assent
and Ransom Turner had gone away happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Money for the new school! It had been
their desire for just this that had put Florence
in her present strange and mysterious
predicament.</p>
<p>It had been a very unusual proposition that
Mr. John Dobson of the Deep Rock Mining
Company had made to them, a proposition
that held great possibilities.</p>
<p>They had gone to him to ask him to help
them with money for the school. He had
told them that his company had no fund
for contributions such as they asked. He
had not, however, turned them away entirely
without hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The company, of which I am President,&rdquo;
he had said, &ldquo;is a comparatively small one.
The stock is not owned by any one rich man,
or by a group of rich men. It is owned by
a number of men who own a little property
and who hope to improve their position by
wise investment. These men look to me to
bring about the success they hope for. Unfortunately,
at the present time we are short
of coal lands. The railroad up this way has
been built for several years. The coal land
that lies along it has been bought up by rich
companies, principally the Inland Coal and
Coke Company, which is so large that it has
come to be looked upon as virtually a monopoly
in these parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one field left to us.&rdquo; His
eyes glanced away to the crest of Pine Mountain.
&ldquo;At the back of that mountain there is
coal, plenty of it. Land is cheap. At present
there is no railroad, but there is a persistent
rumor that the M. and N. proposes to build
a spur up that creek. They will build it.
But when?&rdquo; He had risen to pace the floor
of his small office. &ldquo;When? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The directors of the railroad,&rdquo; he had
gone on after a long pause, &ldquo;are to hold a
meeting next week. They may decide upon
the spur at that time. If it is to be built
within the next year, there is a tract of land
back here that we want&mdash;want badly. It is
owned by a man named Caleb Powers. The
price is twenty-one thousand. Needless to
say, our rich rival will want it. They may
be able to secure advance information regarding
the coming decision of the Directors of
the M. and N. In that case we are defeated.
If they do not, we have a chance. The first
person to get to Caleb Powers after the spur
has been decided upon, will get the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he had paused and looked Florence
squarely in the eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you come in,&rdquo; he had said
steadily. &ldquo;That is, if you wish to. I am
to be away in another section of the mountains
next week&mdash;can&rsquo;t be here. You want
money for your school?&rdquo; He had stared
hard at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-es, we do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, here&rsquo;s your chance. One of
you go back behind Pine Mountain and there
keep in close touch with Caleb Powers. The
other must remain here until news of the
decision regarding the proposed spur comes.
I will arrange for a messenger at the rail&rsquo;s
end. As soon as the messenger arrives you
must make all haste to reach Caleb Powers.
I will give you the earnest money&mdash;five hundred
dollars. If the spur is to be built and
you succeed in purchasing the land, I will
pay you a commission of ten percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo; Florence had exclaimed.
&ldquo;Twenty-one hundred dollars! All that for
the school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visions of a warm, cozy school room,
brightened by many happy, glowing faces,
passed before her mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; she had said with
quiet resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Marion had echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it has come to this,&rdquo; Florence
said to herself as she stirred upon the rustling
corn husks of her bed in the deserted
cabin which formed her temporary hiding
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Once more her mind went back to the
broken sequence of events. It had been
agreed that she should cross over the mountains
and stay with a friend of Mrs. McAlpin
who lived at the back of Pine Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will keep you posted by means of
the Silent Alarm!&rdquo; Marion had exclaimed.</p>
<p>Until now the Silent Alarm had been little
more than a plaything. Now it was to be
of some real use. Florence&rsquo;s older brother,
who had been in the great war, had told her
how, by the use of signal lamps, flashlights
and the Continental code he and his comrades
had been able to signal to one another even
across a point of the enemy&rsquo;s trenches. He
had explained the matter to her in detail, had
also taught her the code. Often at night,
from some distant hillside, with a flashlight
and the barrel of a dismantled shotgun, Florence
had signalled to Marion at the cabin.
And Marion, with some similar simple apparatus,
had signalled back.</p>
<p>The simple-minded, superstitious mountain
folks, having seen these strange stars
blinking away against the mountain, had
whispered weird tales of witch light and
of seeing old women riding a cloud at night.
All this had greatly amused the girls and
they kept their secret well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Marion had said to Florence when
she started on her mission, &ldquo;when you get to
your destination back there, I&rsquo;ll climb this
side of the mountain to the crest and we&rsquo;ll
get in touch with one another by signal fires.
After that, when the big news comes, I&rsquo;ll
climb the mountain again. If it comes in
the daytime I will use a heliograph; if by
night, some form of tube and a flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you have already seen, by the aid of
Marion&rsquo;s beacon fire on the mountain&rsquo;s crest,
they had established communications. But
under what unexpected conditions this was
done! Florence had been the prisoner of
strange men whose motives in holding her
were unknown. This she had flashed back
to Marion. She had added a warning not to
try to come to her.</p>
<p>Bearing this startling news, Marion had
retraced her steps to Mrs. McAlpin&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am a fugitive,&rdquo; Florence
sighed as she sat up among the corn husks.
&ldquo;A fugitive from whom? And why? The
message will come and I will not be able to
deliver it. The coal tract will be lost to the
Inland Coal and Coke Company and our
hopes for a schoolhouse will be blighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; she clinched her fist. &ldquo;It must
not be! There is yet a way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message did come, a message of great
good news. It came on the wings of the
wind, came to Mrs. McAlpin and Marion, late
that very afternoon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on the mountain-side near
the cabin in which Florence was hiding,
strange things were happening. Florence was
wondering about the identity of the rough
mountain men who had made her prisoner.
Were they feudists? Or moonshiners suspecting
her of being a spy? Or real spies
themselves, employed by the great mining
corporation to trap her? Or were they just
plain robbers?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Such were the thoughts running through
her mind when she caught the sound of a
cheery note outside the cabin. It was the
<i>chee-chee-chee, to-wheet, to-wheet, to-wheet</i>
of a mountain wren. The song brightened
her spirits and allayed her fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as he keeps up his joyous notes
I need have no fear,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;The
appearance of someone near would frighten
him into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little friend,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;how
wonderful you are! When human friends
were here you came each year to make your
nest in some niche in their cabin. Now they
are gone. Who knows where? But you,
faithful to their dream of happiness, return to
sing your merry song among the ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she whispered this, her ear caught
a far different note, a dread sound&mdash;the long-drawn
note of a hound.</p>
<p>As this grew louder and louder her heart
beat rapidly with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my trail,&rdquo; she thought with dread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>As the sound began to grow fainter she
felt sure that the hunters, if hunters they
were, had passed on up over the main trail.
Hardly had the hope been born when it was
suddenly dashed aside. The solid thump-thump
of footsteps sounded outside the cabin,
then ended.</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, such a
silence as she had not experienced in all her
days. Flies had ceased to buzz. The little
brown wren had flown away.</p>
<p>Then a harsh voice crashed into that silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon she are up thar, Lige?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no ways possible,&rdquo; drawled the
second man. &ldquo;Look at them thar hollyhocks.
Narry a leaf broke. Reckon airy
one&rsquo;d pass through that door without a
tramplin&rsquo; &rsquo;em down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be stirrin&rsquo; then, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Again came the solid drum of feet. This
grew fainter and fainter until it died away in
the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old hollyhocks! Good little old
sentries, how I could hug you for that!&rdquo; A
tear splashed down upon the girl&rsquo;s hand, a
tear for which none should be ashamed.</p>
<p>Even as the footsteps of the men died
away in the distance, Florence felt the
shadow of the mountain creeping over the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon be dark,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was some time in deciding just what
should be done. Her first impulse was to
take the up-trail as soon as darkness had
fallen and to make her way back to her
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;means the
end of our hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>At once there passed before her closed
eyes pictures of brave, laughing little children
of the mountain; ragged, barefooted,
pleading children, walking miles over the
frosts of November to attend their school, the
first real school they would have known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She set her teeth hard. &ldquo;There is
still a way. I will wait here for Marion&rsquo;s signal.
It will come. If she has news, good
news, somehow I will find my way to Caleb
Powers. Somehow the race must be won!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />A DARTING SHADOW</h2>
<p>That same evening, just at dusk, Marion
came upon a fresh and startling mystery.
She had climbed the hill at the back of the
ancient whipsawed cabin which was occupied
by Mrs. McAlpin and her friends.</p>
<p>Beside the bubbling brook that sang so
softly, she had found she could think calmly.
There was reason enough for calm thinking,
too. They had entered into this business of
buying the Powell coal tract, expecting only
mild adventure and possibly a large profit.
Mysterious things were happening to Florence.
She was sure of that. By the aid of
the Silent Alarm she had received a message
from her. The message had warned her to
retreat, to return to the whipsawed cabin and
wait. She had obeyed.</p>
<p>It was indeed very singular.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; Marion now
asked herself for the hundredth time.
&ldquo;Wherever she may be, she can hardly be
out of reach of the Silent Alarm. Darkness
will find me again on the trail that leads to
the crest of Pine Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must succeed! Must! Must!&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;And I must let her know. I
surely must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very afternoon she had received information
of tremendous importance.</p>
<p>In the whipsawed cabin was a small radio
receiving set. The long twilight of the mountains
often slipped away with a score of
mountain people sitting on the hillside listening
to the sweet strains of music that
came from this radio and floated through
the open windows. At times, even in the
afternoon, they tuned in on Louisville that
they might catch some news of the outside
world. On this particular afternoon, wearied
from her long hike of the previous night,
Marion had been lolling half asleep on the
couch when of a sudden she sat upright, wide
awake. Her ear had caught the words, &ldquo;M.
and N. Railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Here might be important news. It was
important, for the announcer, after a brief
pause in which he had perhaps referred to his
notes, had gone on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a meeting to-day of the Board of Directors
of the M. and N. Railroad, it was decided
that a spur would be built along the
south slope of Pine Mountain. This work,
which is to be rushed to completion within
a year, will tap vast tracks of valuable coal
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion had risen trembling from the
couch. She had wanted to cry, to laugh, to
shout. Here was great news indeed. Coming
right in from the air, it had beyond doubt
given them many hours of advantage over
their rival, the agent of the Inland Coal and
Coke Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>But she had not shouted, nor had she cried
nor laughed. She had climbed the hillside
and had stretched out on the leafy slope by
the murmuring brook to think.</p>
<p>She had decided to wait for darkness.
Then she would hurry away over the four
miles that led to the crest of the low mountain.
Once there she would kindle a beacon
fire.</p>
<p>Down deep in her heart she prayed that
Florence might catch the gleam of that fire
as she had the one of the night before, and
that having caught her joyous message, she
might be free to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it would hurry and get dark!&rdquo;
she whispered to herself. &ldquo;If only it would.
Then I could slip up there and send the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Of a sudden this all
important problem was driven from her mind.
From out the clump of mountain ivy that
skirted the hill above the whipsawed cabin
there had darted a shadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Who could it be? No mysterious persons
were known to be about, but she could not be
sure. Men hid out in these hills&mdash;rough,
dangerous men who were wanted by the law.</p>
<p>The cheery lamplight that suddenly burst
forth through the small square window of
the whipsawed cabin below reassured her.
There were friends in that house, her friends
Mrs. McAlpin and little Hallie.</p>
<p>Even as she settled back again to think
of their great problems, she was given another
start. Outside the window, into the
square of light that poured forth from it,
there had crept the face of a man. It was not
a charming face to behold, but rather an
alarming one. Beneath bushy eyebrows
gleamed a pair of beady black eyes. The nose
was hawk-like and the cheeks and chin were
covered by a stubby beard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>It was a face to make one shudder, and
Marion did shudder. She drew back as if
to bury herself in the giant chestnut at her
back. Even as she did so she saw the man
start, saw an unuttered exclamation spring
to his lips. What had he seen? What had he
hoped to see? There was mystery enough
about that whipsawed cabin. Once there had
been gold in it&mdash;much gold. Preacher Gibson
had hinted that it might still be there. It had
been brought there many years before, just
after the Civil War. Jeff Middleton, who
with the help of a neighbor had built the
cabin, had died suddenly in a feud. The gold
had vanished. No one, so far as was known,
had ever found it.</p>
<p>Who was this man at the window? Did
he at last have a clue to the whereabouts of
the gold, and had he come to search for it,
only to find the cabin occupied?</p>
<p>Little Hallie, too, was quite as mysterious
as the whipsawed cabin in which she lived.
She had been brought to the cabin door on
a stormy night&mdash;a beautiful eight year old
child, unconscious from an ugly blow on her
head. While she was being cared for, the
man who brought her had vanished. He had
not returned. That was three weeks ago.
Efforts to discover the identity of the child&mdash;other
than the name &ldquo;Hallie,&rdquo; which had
come from her own lips&mdash;had been unavailing.
Her memory appeared to have gone
with the blow on her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Fortunately, Mrs. McAlpin had studied
medicine in her younger days. Under her
efficient care Hallie had become the cheery
joy of the whipsawed house.</p>
<p>Did this mysterious man know something
about little Hallie? Or was he just some
wanderer looking for food and shelter? This
last seemed the most probable.</p>
<p>Yet, as Marion came to this conclusion, she
suddenly learned that this man knew something
about one member of the household,
for even as she sat there he passed close
enough to touch her, mumbling as he passed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s her. Hit shorely are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart went into double-quick
time as the man came near to her. It slowed
down very little as he vanished into the night.
Questions were pounding away at her brain.
Who was this man? What did he want? To
whom had he referred? To Mrs. McAlpin?
To Hallie?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been Hallie,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;And now perhaps he will steal upon us
unawares and carry her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she thought this she felt that it
was a foolish fear. Why should he?</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, as a new thought struck
her, she sprang to her feet. A cry was on
her lips, but it died unuttered.</p>
<p>It had suddenly occurred to her that if this
man knew something about this mysterious
little girl he should be called back and questioned.</p>
<p>She did not call him back. She was afraid,
very much afraid of that man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she reassured herself, &ldquo;he probably
didn&rsquo;t mean Hallie at all. Probably
meant Mrs. McAlpin. She&rsquo;s been here three
summers, and has been up every creek for
miles around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>With this as a concluding thought, and
having caught the delicious odor of spring
chicken roasting on the hearth, she hurried
down to supper.</p>
<p>As she entered the cabin, Mrs. McAlpin,
who was a famous cook, lifted the lid of the
small cast-iron oven that had been buried beneath
the hearth coals for an hour. At once
the room was filled with such delectable
fragrance as only can come from such an
oven.</p>
<p>Since the cabin had been purchased by its
present owner, it had not been disfigured by
a stove. An immense stone fireplace graced
the corner of each of the four rooms. The
cooking was done on the hearth of the room
used as kitchen and dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful!&rdquo; Marion exclaimed
as she hung her sweater on the deer&rsquo;s antlers
which served as a coat rack. &ldquo;Just to live
like this! To be primitive as our ancestors
were! I shall never forget it, not as long as
I live!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Supper was over. Darkness had fallen
&ldquo;from the wings of night&rdquo; when Marion
slipped alone out of the whipsawed cabin.</p>
<p>As she entered the shadows that lay across
the path that led away from the cabin, she
caught sound of a movement off to the right.</p>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat, but she did not
pause. The message she had to send could
not be longer delayed. And yet, as she hurried
on, she could not help wondering who
might have been behind the bushes. Was it
the prowler, he of the beady black eyes and
hooked nose, who had peered in at the cabin
window? If it were, what did he want?
What did he mean by that strange exclamation:
&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s her?&rdquo; Had he seen Hallie? Did
he know her? Would he attempt to carry
her away? She hoped not. The little girl
had become a spot of sunshine in that brown
old cabin.</p>
<p>Two hours later the proceedings of the
previous night were being re-enacted. Marion&rsquo;s
beacon fire appeared on the mountain&rsquo;s
crest. Florence caught it at once and flashed
back her answer. There followed a half hour
of signaling. At the end of this half hour
Florence found herself sitting breathless
among the husks in the cabin loft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;What news! The
railroad is to be built. I wonder if the land
is still for sale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; she exclaimed, squaring her
shoulders, &ldquo;I must be afraid no longer.
Somehow I must find my way down this
slope to Caleb Powell&rsquo;s home. I must buy
that land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She patted the crinkly bills, five hundred
dollars, still pinned to the inside of her blouse.
Then, slipping quickly down the ladder, she
stepped into the cool, damp air of night.</p>
<p>Yet, even as she turned to go down the
mountain, courage failed her.</p>
<p>Above her, not so far away but that she
could reach it in an hour, hung the mountain&rsquo;s
crest. Dim, dark, looming in the misty
moonlight, it seemed somehow to beckon.
Beyond it, down the trail, lay home, her
mountain home, and loving friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>She had experienced thus far only distrust,
captivity without apparent cause, the great
fear of worse things to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo; Her
feet moved slowly up the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I must!&rdquo; She faced the other
way. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back and say to them, &lsquo;I
have no money for the school. I went on a
mission and failed because I was afraid.&rsquo; No,
No! I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, lest this last resolve should fail her,
she fairly ran down the trail.</p>
<p>She had hurried on for fully fifteen minutes
when again she paused, paused this time to
consider. What plan had she? What was
she to do? She did not know the way to the
home of her friend, nor to the home of Caleb
Powell. Indeed, she did not so much as know
where she was. How, then, was she to find
Caleb Powell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one way,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I must
risk it. At some cabin I must inquire my
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later she found herself near
a cabin. A dim light shone in the window.
For a moment she hesitated beside the footpath
that led to its door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said at last, starting on, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t try that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She passed three others before her courage
rose to the sticking point. At last, realizing
that the evening was well spent and that all
would soon be in bed, she forced herself to
walk boldly toward a cabin. A great bellowing
hound rushed out at her and sent her
heart to her mouth. The welcome sound of
a man&rsquo;s voice silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s thar?&rdquo; the voice rang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s I, Florence Huyler.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s
voice trembled in spite of her effort to control
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; The man held a candle to
her face. &ldquo;Step inside, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I&mdash;I
only wanted to ask where Caleb Powell
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Bill,&rdquo; the man turned to someone
within the cabin. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that girl we was
lookin&rsquo; for this evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw &rsquo;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t stand to reason.&rdquo; The
man&rsquo;s feet came to the floor with a crash.
The girl&rsquo;s heart sank. She recognized the
voices of the men. They were the men who
had visited the deserted cabin. The hollyhock
sentinel had done their bit, but all to no
purpose. She was once more virtually a
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you come to the wrong cabin, Miss.
We are plumb sorry, but hit are our bond an&rsquo;
duty to sort of ask you to come in and rest
with we-all a spell. Reckon you ain&rsquo;t et none.
Hey, Mandy! Set on a cold snack for this
here young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence walked slowly into the cabin and
sank wearily into a chair. Her head, which
seemed suddenly to grow heavy, sank down
upon her breast. She had meant so well, and
this was what fate had dealt her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Suddenly, as she sat there filled with
gloomy thoughts, came one gloomier than
the rest&mdash;a thought as melancholy as a late
autumn storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we not think of that?&rdquo; she
almost groaned aloud.</p>
<p>She recalled it well enough now. Mrs.
McAlpin had once told her of the queer mixing
of titles to land which existed all over
the mountains. In the early days, when land
was all but worthless, a man might trade a
thousand acres of land for a yoke of oxen
and no deed given or recorded. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
Mrs. McAlpin had said, &ldquo;when I purchased
the little tract on which this cabin stands I
was obliged to wait an entire year before my
lawyer was able to assure me of a deed
that would hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year!&rdquo; Florence repeated to herself.
&ldquo;A year for a small tract! And here we are
hoping to purchase a tract containing thousands
of acres which was once composed of
numerous small tracts. And we hope to get
a deed day after to-morrow, and our commission
a day later.&rdquo; She laughed in spite of
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we succeed in making the purchase,
which doesn&rsquo;t seem at all likely, Mr. Dobson
may be two years getting a clear title to the
land. Will he pay our commission before
that? No one would expect it. And if we
don&rsquo;t get it before that time what good will
it do our school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she told herself, facing the problem
squarely, &ldquo;there must be some other way;
though I&rsquo;ll still go through with this if opportunity
offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her mental search for &ldquo;some other
way&rdquo; her thoughts returned to the ancient
whipsawed house on Laurel Branch. She
had heard old preacher Gibson&rsquo;s story of Jeff
Middleton&rsquo;s return from the Civil War with
a great sack of strange gold pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s hid som&rsquo;ers about that ar whipsawed
cabin,&rdquo; the tottering old mountain
preacher had declared, &ldquo;though whar it
might be I don&rsquo;t rightly know. Been a
huntin&rsquo; of it right smart o&rsquo; times and ain&rsquo;t
never lit onto narry one of them coins yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could find that gold,&rdquo; Florence
told herself, &ldquo;all would be well. That
is, if we win the election&mdash;if we elect our
trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled a little at this last thought; yet
it was no joking matter, this electing a trustee
back here in the Cumberlands. Many a
grave on the sun kissed hillsides, where the
dogwood blooms in springtime and ripe chestnuts
come rattling down in the autumn,
marks the spot where some lusty mountaineer
lies buried. And it might be written on
his tombstone, &ldquo;He tried to elect a trustee
and failed because the other man&rsquo;s pistol gun
found its mark.&rdquo; Elections are hard fought
in the Cumberlands. Many a bitter feud
fight has been started over a school election.</p>
<p>Surely, as she sat there once more a prisoner,
held by these mysterious mountaineers,
there was enough to disturb her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />A STRANGE ESCAPE</h2>
<p>Morning came at last. Florence stirred
beneath the home woven covers of her bed
in the mountain cabin. Then she woke to
the full realization of her position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prisoner in a cabin,&rdquo; she groaned.
&ldquo;And yet they do not treat me badly. For
my supper they set on the table the best they
had. It meant a real sacrifice for them to
give up this entire room to me, yet they did
it. I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not let them defeat me!&rdquo; She
brought her feet down with a slap upon the
clean scrubbed and sanded floor. &ldquo;Somehow,
by some means or another, I must make my
way to Caleb Powell&rsquo;s home to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Her eyes lighted upon an object that hung
above the fireplace&mdash;a long barreled squirrel
rifle with a shiny new cap resting beneath the
hammer. &ldquo;Loaded,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Cap
wouldn&rsquo;t be there if it wasn&rsquo;t. They left it
hanging there because I am a girl and they
were certain I couldn&rsquo;t shoot. Hump! I can
shoot as straight as any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment a wild vision whirled before
her&mdash;a vision of a girl bursting from a room,
yelling like a wild Indian and brandishing the
long rifle above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t do. It
would be very dramatic, but it would probably
end in tragedy, and I have no desire to
act a part in such a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dressed quickly, then stepped into the
other room of the cabin where she found
crisp, brown biscuits, wild honey and fried
eggs awaiting her.</p>
<p>She ate a hearty breakfast. &ldquo;Who knows
what strength I may need for this day?&rdquo; she
thought to herself as she spread honey on
her third biscuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>After that, knowing from past experiences
what her limitations would be, she did not
attempt to go many steps from the cabin but
contented herself with sitting outside the
cabin door in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a lovely scene,&rdquo; she sighed as she
looked away and away to where the peaks
of Pine Mountain blended with the bluer
peaks of Big Black Mountain, and all at last
were lost in the hazy mists of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So peaceful,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d think
there had never been a bit of trouble since
the world began. And yet, right down here
in the mountains there is more trouble than
anywhere else in the country. Some men
say that Nature, God&rsquo;s open book, will make
men good and kind. It takes more than that.
It takes&mdash;it must take God inside their hearts
to accomplish that.&rdquo; So she mused, and half
the morning slipped away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>From time to time her eyes left the mountain
tops to follow the winding stream that,
some fifty feet down a gentle slope, went
rushing and tumbling over its rocky bed.
Above and beyond this creek bed, at the other
side of the gorge, ran a trail. Down that
trail from time to time people passed. Now
a woman, leading a lean pack horse laden
with corn, shambled along on her way to
mill. Now a pair of active, shouting boys
urged on a team of young bullocks hitched
to a sled, and now a bearded mountaineer,
with rifle slung across his saddle horn, rode
at a dog trot down the dusty trail.</p>
<p>The girl watched all this with dreamy eyes.
They meant nothing to her; were, in fact, but
a part of the scenery.</p>
<p>Still she watched the trail, taking little interest
in the people passing there until suddenly
she came to life with surprising interest.
A person of evident importance was
passing up the trail. He sat upon a blooded
sorrel horse, and across the pommel of his
saddle was a rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Florence asked, interested
in the way this man sat his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That? Why, that are Caleb Powell.&rdquo;
Her guard, who sat not far from her, had
also spoken without thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caleb Powell!&rdquo; The girl sprang to her
feet. In an instant her two hands were
cupped into a trumpet and she had sent out
a loud call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo-hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caught by rocky walls, the call came echoing
back. The man on the blooded horse
turned his gaze toward the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you can&rsquo;t do that away!&rdquo; The
guard put a rough hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, and I will!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone was
low and fierce. &ldquo;You take your hands away
from me, and keep them off!&rdquo; She jerked
away. &ldquo;I came back here to see him. He&rsquo;s
a man, a real man, and he&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowering, the man fell back a step.</p>
<p>Again the girl&rsquo;s hands were cupped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Powell! Come over!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I
have something important to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The man reined in his horse, stared across
the gorge in apparent surprise, then directed
his horse down a narrow path that led down
one side of the gorge and up the other.</p>
<p>Standing there, leaning against the doorpost,
the girl watched him with all the fascination
that a condemned man must feel as he
sees a man approaching with a message commuting
his sentence.</p>
<p>The man who, a few minutes later, came
riding up the steep trail to the cabin, was
quite as different from the average mountaineer
as Florence had, at a distance, judged
him to be. His face was smooth shaven and
his gray suit, his tie, his leggings, his riding
boots, all were in good order. When at last
he spoke it was not in the vernacular of the
mountains, but of the wide world outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you have some coal land?&rdquo; she
hesitated as he asked what he might do for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, little girl,&rdquo; he smiled as he
spoke. &ldquo;My brothers and I have several
acres up these slopes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Florence stiffened at his &ldquo;little girl.&rdquo; She
realized that he had used the term in kindness,
but he must not think of her as a little
girl. She was for a moment a business
woman with an important transaction to carry
through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to sell it?&rdquo; she said briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have offered to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For twenty-one thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that.&rdquo; He was staring at her now.
He stared harder when she said: &ldquo;I am
authorized to buy it at that price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he did not speak; just kept
his keen grey eyes upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; he said at last in a droll
drawl, &ldquo;for the smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you are joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not joking.&rdquo; She was tempted to be
angry now. &ldquo;Here&mdash;here&rsquo;s the proof. It&rsquo;s
the&mdash;Mr. Dobson called it the earnest
money.&rdquo; She dragged the five hundred dollars
in bank notes from her blouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>For ten seconds after that her heart fluttered
wildly. What if this whole affair were
a game played by these men at her expense?
What if this man was not Caleb Powell at
all? The thought of the consequences made
her head whirl.</p>
<p>But no, the guard of a half hour before
was staring, popeyed, at the sheaf of bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like business,&rdquo; said Caleb
Powell. &ldquo;Your Mr. Dobson&mdash;I know him
well. So he made you his agent? Well, well!
That&rsquo;s singular. But men do strange things.
I suppose he sent a contract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; She was eager now. &ldquo;Here
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Then turning to the former guard, he said;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be wanting anything further
of the girl, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon not,&rdquo; the man drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ormsby,&rdquo; she volunteered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Miss Ormsby, if you&rsquo;ll be so kind
as to mount behind me, I&rsquo;ll take you down
to the house. We&rsquo;ll fix up the papers. After
that we&rsquo;ll have a bite to eat and I&rsquo;ll send you
over the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hours that followed were long-to-be-remembered.
The signing of the papers, the
talk on the cool veranda, a perfect dinner,
then the long, long ride home over the mountains
on a perfect horse with a guide and
guard at her side, and all this crowned by
the consciousness of a wonderful success after
days of perils and threatened failure; all these
seemed a dream indeed.</p>
<p>One thing Florence remembered distinctly.
She had said to Caleb Powell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Powell, why did those men wish to
hold me prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ormsby,&rdquo; he said, and there was no
smile upon his lips, &ldquo;some of our people are
what you might call &lsquo;plumb quare&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all he had said, and for some
time to come that was all she was destined
to know about the reason for her mysterious
captivity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Only one thought troubled her as she
neared the whipsawed cabin, and that, she
told herself, was only a bad dream.</p>
<p>That it was more than a dream she was
soon to learn. Two days later Mr. Dobson,
having dismounted at their cabin, smiled with
pleasure when he was told of the successful
purchase of Caleb Powell&rsquo;s coal land. Then
for a moment a frown darkened his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hate to tell you,&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; said Florence quickly.
&ldquo;Please allow me to guess. You were about
to tell us that it is necessary to spend a great
deal of time looking up records and getting
papers signed before you have a clear title to
this mountain land, and that we can&rsquo;t have
our money until you have your title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That puts it a little strongly,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobson, smiling a little strangely. &ldquo;As fast
as we can clear up the titles to certain tracts
my company has authorized me to pay that
portion of the commission. I should say you
ought to have your first installment within
four months. It may be six, however. Matters
move slowly here in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Four months!&rdquo; exclaimed Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sooner, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four&mdash;&rdquo; Marion began, but Florence
squeezed her arm as she whispered; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
use. We can&rsquo;t help it and neither can they?
There must be some other way. Besides, we
haven&rsquo;t yet elected our trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />SAFE AT HOME</h2>
<p>That night, for the first time in many
days, Florence found herself ready to creep
beneath the hand woven blankets beside her
pal. Ah, it was good to feel the touch of
comfort and the air of security to be found
there. What did it matter that after all the
struggle and danger she had found her efforts
crowned only by partial success? Time
would reveal some other way. New problems
beckoned. Let them come. Life was full
of problems, and solving them is life itself.</p>
<p>The whipsawed house in which the girls
lived had been built more than sixty years
before. The heavy beams of its frame and
the broad thick boards of its sheeting inside
and out had been sawed by hand from massive
poplar logs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The walls of the room in which the girls
slept were as frankly free of paint or paper
as when the boards were first laid in place.
But time and sixty summers of Kentucky
mountain sunshine had imparted to every
massive beam and every broad board such
a coat of deep, mellow, old gold as any millionaire
might covet for his palace.</p>
<p>Heavy, hand-cut sandstone formed the fireplace.
Before this fireplace, on a black bearskin,
in dream-robes and dressing gowns, sat
the two girls curled up for a chat before retiring.</p>
<p>Then it was that Marion told of the mysterious
stranger who had peered in at the
window at dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Florence as a puzzled
look knotted her brow. &ldquo;Who could he
have meant when he said, &lsquo;Hit&rsquo;s her&rsquo;? Could
he have meant Mrs. McAlpin?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. She&rsquo;s been around doctoring
people a great deal. He might have seen her
somewhere; might even have needed her services
for his family and been too timid to ask
for it. You know how these mountain folks
are. But&mdash;&rdquo; Marion paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t believe it was Mrs. McAlpin,&rdquo;
prompted Florence, leaning toward the
fire. &ldquo;Neither do I. I believe it was little
Hallie, and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Marion with a sudden
dab at the fire that sent the sparks flying.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose we ought to want her identity
to be discovered, want her returned to her
people, but she&rsquo;s come to mean so much to
us. She&rsquo;s a dashing little bit of sunshine.
This place,&rdquo; her eyes swept the bare brown
walls, &ldquo;this place would seem dreary without
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;will we be able
to elect our trustee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al Finley and Moze Berkhart taught the
school last year. They taught a month or
two; then when it got cold they discouraged
the children all they could, and when finally
no one came they rode up and looked in every
day, then rode home again, and drew their
pay just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we wouldn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;d manage somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion,&rdquo; said Florence after they had sat
in silence for some time, their arms around
each other, &ldquo;this building belongs to Mrs.
McAlpin, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. She bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everything inside belongs to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Jeff Middleton&rsquo;s gold&mdash;if it&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if we found the gold we could use
it to buy repairs for the schoolhouse, couldn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Marion, &ldquo;and if the moon
is really made of green cheese, and we could
get a slice of it, we might ripen it and have
it for to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But preacher Gibson thinks it&rsquo;s hidden
somewhere about here. He saw it, over sixty
years ago. When Jeff Middleton came home
from the war he came from Georgia driving
a white mule hitched to a kind of sled with
a box on it, and on the sled, along with some
other things, was a bag of gold. Not real
coins, Preacher Gibson said, but just like
them; &lsquo;sort of queer-like coins,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just the
way he said it. There wasn&rsquo;t anything to
spend gold for back here in the mountains in
those days. He built this house, so he must
have hidden the gold here. He lived here
until he was killed. The gold must still be
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right,&rdquo; said Marion with a
merry little laugh, &ldquo;but I imagine the schoolhouse
windows will have to be patched with
something other than that gold. And besides&mdash;&rdquo;
she rose, yawning, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t even
got the positions yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d refuse to hire us?
Just think! Those boys who tried to teach
last year couldn&rsquo;t even do fractions, and there
wasn&rsquo;t a history nor a geography in the
place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; said Marion.</p>
<p>In this she was more right than she knew.</p>
<p>A moment later Florence crept beneath the
homewoven blankets. A little while longer
Marion sat dreamily gazing at the darkening
coals. Then, drawing her dressing gown
tightly about her, she stepped to the door
and slipped out. Like most mountain homes,
the door of every room in the cabin opened
onto the porch.</p>
<p>Stepping to the edge of the porch, she
stood there, bathed in moonlight. The night
was glorious. Big Black Mountain, laying
away in the distance, seemed the dark tower
of some clan of the giants. Below, and
nearer, she caught the reflection of the moon
in a placid pool on Laurel Branch, while close
at hand the rhododendrons wove a fancy border
of shadows along the trail that led away
to the bottom lands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>As the girl stood drinking in the splendor
of it all, she gave a sudden start, then shrank
back into the shadows. Had she caught the
sound of shuffled footsteps, of a pebble rolling
down the steep trail? She thought so.
With a shudder she stepped through the door,
closed it quickly, and let the heavy bar fall
silently into place. Then, without a word,
she crept beneath the covers. As an involuntary
shudder seized her she felt her companion&rsquo;s
strong arms about her. So, soothed and
reassured, she rested there for a moment. She
and Florence had been pals for many long
months. Strange and thrilling were the mysteries
they had solved, the adventures they had
experienced. What would the morrow bring?
More mystery, greater adventures? At any
rate, they would face them together, and with
these thoughts her eyes closed in dreamless
sleep.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />CONFEDERATE GOLD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re thinking of going into politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Cawood, a frank-faced college boy of
the mountains, who had become a friend of
the two girls, brushed the tangled locks from
his eyes and laughed a merry laugh as he
repeated, &ldquo;Going into politics! You two
girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Marion with a
frown and an involuntary stamp of her foot.
&ldquo;Teaching school isn&rsquo;t going into politics,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just better believe it is! Anyway,
it is if you&rsquo;re to teach here in the mountains
and draw your pay from the State. You&rsquo;ll
have to elect you a trustee, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll
have to do. It&rsquo;s always done. And believe
me, that calls for a right smart of a scrap!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Ralph!&rdquo; Marion exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know we&rsquo;ve nearly finished college, that
we are better qualified than most of the teachers
in the Mountain Academy at Middlesburg,
and that the teachers they&rsquo;ve had before
scarcely knew how to read and write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ralph, his face suddenly growing
sober, &ldquo;they know all that, and more.
But think of the money! This school at the
mouth of Laurel Branch pays over seven
hundred dollars. Last year Al Finley was
head teacher. He paid his assistant twenty
dollars a month. School lasts six months.
That left him nearly six hundred for six
months work, and he didn&rsquo;t work half the
time at that. If he&rsquo;d worked at freighting,
logging or getting out barrel staves, he
couldn&rsquo;t have earned that much in two
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the children!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Ralph still more soberly,
&ldquo;but nobody thinks of them; at least
not enough. I never got much good out of
country school. Nobody expects to. My
brother, who&rsquo;d been outside to school, taught
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t they get good out of
it? What do they think the school is for?&rdquo;
Marion&rsquo;s brow was knit in a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For drawing the State&rsquo;s money, I guess.
Anyway, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s always been for.
But you just go ahead,&rdquo; he added cheerfully.
&ldquo;Try it out. See if you can elect you a
trustee. Ransom Turner is for you from the
start, and he counts for a lot. A good many
folks believe in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; said Marion. Her lips were
set in straight lines of determination. &ldquo;If
we must go into politics in order to do the
right thing, we will!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>It was a daring resolve. Life surely is
strange at times. Very often the thing we
did not want yesterday becomes the one
thing we most desire to-day. It was so
with Marion and the winter school. There
had been a time when it took a hard fight to
bring her mind to the sticking point where
she could say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo; Now she suddenly
resolved that nothing but defeat could
drive her away.</p>
<p>And yet, as she sat quietly talking to Florence
a half hour later, the whole situation
seemed incredible. It seemed beyond belief
that men could be so selfish as to draw the
money that rightfully belonged to their children
and to their neighbors&rsquo; children, with no
notion of giving any service in return for it.</p>
<p>If the girls lacked proof that there would
be a fight, they were not long in finding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to Ransom Turner&rsquo;s store,
and ask him about it,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll tell us straight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Before they reached Ransom&rsquo;s store they
learned much. News travels fast in the mountains.
This was mill day. All the mountain
folks were at the mouth of the creek with
their grist of corn to be ground into meal for
corn bread. Some on horse back, some on
foot, and one or two driving young bullocks
hitched to sleds, they came in crowds. One
and all talked of the coming school election
and how Al Finley and his political backer,
Black Blevens, were likely to have a race
worthy of the name. Ralph had told someone
of his talk with Marion. That person
had told two others; these others had carried
the news to the mill. Now all knew and
already they were lining up, on this side or
that, for the coming battle.</p>
<p>As the girls passed through group after
group, they felt that the very atmosphere
about them had changed. It was as if a
threatening storm hung over the mountain
top. Everyone smiled and spoke, but there
was a difference. One could scarcely tell
what it was; perhaps an inflection of the
voice, perhaps the tightening of the muscles
about the mouth. Whatever it was, Marion,
who was a keen student of human nature,
felt that she could say almost to certainty:
&ldquo;That one is for us; this one against us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>There were few doubtful ones. Mountain
folks are quick to make decisions and slow to
change them.</p>
<p>A little lump came to Marion&rsquo;s throat as
she realized that the people they passed were
about evenly divided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; she whispered with a
little choke down deep in her throat, &ldquo;only
yesterday they were all so cordial. They
praised us for the education we were giving
their children. They&rsquo;ve all asked us out to
dinner many times. &lsquo;Come and stay a week&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what they said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence smiled without bitterness,
&ldquo;but this summer we have been teaching
their children for nothing. We are about to
ask them to let their State pay us the money
coming to them for teaching their winter
school. Black Blevens has always controlled
that. He&rsquo;s unprincipled, but he&rsquo;s rich and
powerful as mountain folks go. He&rsquo;s given
work to many of these people when they
needed it badly. Many of them are kin to
him&mdash;belong to his clan. As they would say,
they are &lsquo;beholden&rsquo; to him. Whatever his
battle is, they must fight it. They&rsquo;re living
back in the feudal days. And that,&rdquo; said this
big strong girl, swinging her arms on high,
&ldquo;is what makes me love it. I&rsquo;d like to have
been born a knight in those good old days.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Scotts wha hae wi&rsquo; Wallace bled,</p>
<p class="t">Scotts wham Bruce has aften led,</p>
<p class="t0">Welcome to your gory bed,</p>
<p class="t2">Or to victory!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She threw back her head and laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to get out my &lsquo;Lady of the Lake&rsquo; and
my &lsquo;Lays of the Last Minstrels&rsquo; to-night.
And in the fight that lies before us I&rsquo;m going
to live over those days of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What! Warder Ho! Let the portcullis
fall&rsquo;,&rdquo; Marion murmured with a smile.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Ransom Turner&rsquo;s store. &lsquo;Dismount,
and let&rsquo;s within&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>The low board shack which they entered
did little to carry forward the illusion of castles,
moats and drawbridges. From within,
instead of the clang of armor, there came the
sound of a hammer bursting in the head of
a barrel of salt pork.</p>
<p>The man who stepped forward to greet
them carried little resemblance to a knight of
old. Ransom Turner was a small man, with
close cropped hair and grimy hands. And
yet, who can judge the strength and grandeur
of a soul? There was a steady, piercing fire
in the little man&rsquo;s eyes that was like the even
flow of an electrical current through a white
hot wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard what you said to Ralph this
mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Reckon that
means right smart of a scrap, but I ca&rsquo;culate
we&rsquo;ll lick Black Blevens and his crowd this
time. Leastwise, it looks thataway. Folks
have took to believin&rsquo; in Mrs. McAlpin, an&rsquo;
in you two&mdash;took to it a heap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But looka here,&rdquo; he drew them off into a
corner. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think hit&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be
easy! Talk about Brimstone Corner! Hit&rsquo;ll
be worse &rsquo;an that afore hit&rsquo;s finished! Gun
play, like as not, and people drove off into
the hills. Mortgages foreclosed on &rsquo;em as
don&rsquo;t aim to vote to suit old Black Blevens.
But you&rsquo;ll stay? You ain&rsquo;t afeared, be y&rsquo;?&rdquo;
The fire seemed to fairly shoot from his pale
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence said quietly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You needn&rsquo;t be. You don&rsquo;t
never need to be. There&rsquo;s mounting folks,
an&rsquo; heaps of em&rsquo;, as would leave their firesides
an&rsquo; fight for them that comes here to help
their children out of the ignorance we&rsquo;re all
in. You believe that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; said Florence. The sound of her
voice was as solemn as it had been the day
she joined the church.</p>
<p>As the two girls left the store they felt
exactly as they might have done had they
been living hundreds of years ago, and had
come from a conference with their feudal
lords.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; whispered Florence as
they passed around the corner and out of
sight, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m going to like it. Fighting
just because you&rsquo;re naturally quarrelsome
is disgraceful. But fighting for a cause, that
you may help those who are weaker than
yourself, that&rsquo;s glorious.&rdquo; She flung her arms
wide, &ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped short. Only by a narrow margin
had she escaped enfolding in those outflung
arms a curious little old man who had
just emerged from a bypath.</p>
<p>Dressed in loose-fitting homespun jacket
and trousers, with shoes that were two sizes
too large and hard enough to stand alone
either side up, and with a home tanned squirrel
skin cap that had shrunken to half its
size in the first rain it encountered, this man
formed a ludicrous figure.</p>
<p>The girls did not laugh. This was Preacher
Gibson. &ldquo;Uncle Billie&rdquo; many called him.
He it was who had told them of old Jeff Middleton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho-Ho! Here you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I been lookin&rsquo; for you all. I got a notion
about that ar gold. Hit war Confederate
gold that old Jeff brought back from the
war. Reg&rsquo;lar old Confederate gold hit war
fer sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle Billie, how do you know the
Confederates coined any gold money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, child!&rdquo; Uncle Billie looked at her
in shocked surprise. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Jeff Davis take
the mint at New Orleans? An&rsquo; waren&rsquo;t there
a power of gold in that there mint? Hain&rsquo;t
there powers of hit in all them mints? In
course of reason there are. Hit&rsquo;s what mints
are for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle Billie, Jeff Middleton wasn&rsquo;t
a Confederate soldier, was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never hearn that he were,&rdquo; Uncle Billie&rsquo;s
face fell for a moment. Then his countenance
brightened. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t never tell &rsquo;bout
folks, kin you? Jeff came home dressed in
brown homespun and drivin&rsquo; a mule hitched
to a sled, the all-firedest kickin&rsquo; mule you ever
seed, and on that ar sled war that sack of
quare gold. Jeff was plum quare hisself.
Who knows but he fit the Union arter all, and
got that ar gold fer his pay?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem very likely,&rdquo; said Marion.
&ldquo;The Confederate soldiers weren&rsquo;t paid
when the war ended. But the gold might
have been plunder. Jeff may have been a
Union soldier with Sherman on his march
to the sea. There was plenty of plunder
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he might. So he might,&rdquo; agreed Uncle
Billie.</p>
<p>He sat down upon a flat rock and appeared
to lose himself in deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he exclaimed, leaping to
his feet, &ldquo;if you all had that gold right now
you could do a power of good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we could,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;We
could have the schoolhouse windows and
doors put in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Uncle Billie said, with a scratch of
his wooly head, &ldquo;but &rsquo;t&rsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be no use
unless you come out on top in that ar school
election. I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he moved close and
whispered in the girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some no
&rsquo;count folks livin&rsquo; up on Shader Branch that&rsquo;s
mighty nigh got no sense. Them folks allus
sells their vote to the one that pays &rsquo;em most.
If&rsquo;n we had that ar gold we&rsquo;d put a piece
whar they all could find it and they&rsquo;d come
down an&rsquo; vote fer our trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Florence emphatically.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bribery. It&rsquo;s unlawful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it is,&rdquo; agreed Uncle Billie, &ldquo;but
so&rsquo;s a heap more of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we wouldn&rsquo;t buy a vote,&rdquo; said
Florence. &ldquo;Not if we had all the gold in the
world. Our trustee will have to win fair and
square, or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely hit&rsquo;ll be not at all,&rdquo; grumbled
Uncle Billie as he went stamping away. It
was plain enough that he did not understand
that fine point of ethics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Above the whipsawed cabin, a few hundred
paces up the side of Little Black Mountain,
a brook emerged from the dark shadows
of its closely thatched roof of rhododendrons.
Coming in shadows from ice cold springs
above, the waters of this brook were always
chilled. As they rushed downward toward
the river they spread about them a refreshing
coolness that defied the hottest summer sun.</p>
<p>Beside this brook, Marion loved to sit and
think. The feel of the cool, damp air was
like the touch of a calm personality, the murmur
of the brook was like the voice of a
calm, counselling friend.</p>
<p>On the evening of the day into which so
much surprise and excitement had been
crowded, she took little Hallie by the hand
and together they scrambled up the steep
mountain side until, flushed and quite out of
breath, they threw themselves down on a
bed of moss beside the cool stream.</p>
<p>Hallie did not remain long in repose. Restless
as a bee, she was soon up and away.
First she chased a chipmunk to his rocky lair,
then she busied herself in the engrossing task
of hunting the peculiar &ldquo;sang&rdquo; leaf which
might mark the hiding place of a treasure
of ginsing roots. Dressed as she was in a
bright yellow dress, she reminded Marion of
a yellow butterfly flitting from leaf to leaf,
from blossom to blossom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>All too soon she was quite forgotten, for
as the shadows lengthened Marion thought
of the problems and possibilities that lay before
them. They had decided to help elect
a school trustee. Ransom Turner would run.
Many people believed in him. Were there
enough to elect him? She hoped so, yet she
doubted. Florence had said they would not
buy votes, and they would not. But how
about Black Blevens? He would force men
to vote for him as trustee. He would use
every means, fair or foul, to win. &ldquo;And what
of the free school we are teaching now?&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Will he try to interfere with
that?&rdquo; She decided it would be well to be
on guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;there
are thrills and adventures enough to be had
down here in the Cumberlands. Yes, and
mystery as well&mdash;even the mystery of Confederate
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>She was thinking of Uncle Billie Gibson
and what he had said about the gold that
haunted the whipsawed house. She found it
hard to believe that the Confederate States
had coined gold, and harder still to think that
there might be a quantity of it hidden away
in the old house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if there should be,&rdquo; she caught her
breath, &ldquo;if we should find it! Each coin
would be worth a fabulous sum. Every
museum in the country would want one, and
every private collector. If it were only true,&rdquo;
she whispered low, and the brook seemed to
murmur, &ldquo;true, true, true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, rudely awakened from
her dreams, she sprang to her feet. A piercing
scream had struck her ears. This was
followed by another and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, too frightened to
move. &ldquo;Hallie! What can have happened
to her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>At that instant there flashed before her
mind a picture of a face in a square of light,
an ugly face with bushy eyebrows, unshaven
cheeks and beady eyes&mdash;the face of the
strange man she had seen at the cabin
window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />MYSTERIOUS FOOTSTEPS</h2>
<p>Scarcely a moment had elapsed after Hallie&rsquo;s
last scream when she sprang sobbing
into Marion&rsquo;s arms. Without a question regarding
the cause of her fright, the older
girl gathered her up and went racing down
the mountain. It was a headlong flight.
Now they were in danger of a plunge down
the steep slope, and now, having stepped
upon a round pebble, Marion rolled twice her
length to land against a stout sapling that
saved them from dashing over a cliff. Yet,
somehow, at last they found themselves safe
in Marion&rsquo;s room, seated by the fire, with the
door securely bolted behind them. Then, and
only then, did Hallie cease her sobbing to
sit staring round-eyed at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What frightened you?&rdquo; Marion asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; the little girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he try to catch you?&rdquo; Marion was
eager now. She was sure she could describe
that man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He only stood and stared at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why were you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very ugly man, and&mdash;and it
seemed like I had seen him before in&mdash;in&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated, &ldquo;maybe in a bad dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Marion was excited. Perhaps here
was a clue to the little girl&rsquo;s lost identity.
Perhaps she had seen the man before in that
other life lived before the blow on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could find that man, perhaps he
could tell me,&rdquo; she told herself. Yet she
knew right well that nothing could induce
her to return to the mountain that night to
search for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say anything?&rdquo; she asked after
a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the little girl spoke quickly. &ldquo;He
said: &lsquo;Hit&rsquo;s her. Hit shorely are&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Marion started. What further proof did
she need that this was the man she had seen
peering in at their window? One more thing
was certain, too; it had been the little lost
girl he had thought of when he said, &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the fireside council that night all the
events of the day were discussed. Mrs. McAlpin
approved to the fullest extent the girls&rsquo;
resolve to make a stand in the interest of the
mountain children and to do all in their
power to elect a school trustee who had the
children&rsquo;s interest at heart. She would do
all within her power to help win the election.</p>
<p>In regard to the mysterious man and little
Hallie, it was decided that should the man be
seen again, every effort would be made to
obtain information from him regarding the
identity of the child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; said Mrs. McAlpin,
&ldquo;we must keep an eye on the child every
moment. It is one thing to find her parents,
quite another to have her spirited away by
one who may have no claim whatever upon
her. At school, at home, at work, at play,
she must be carefully guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the council broke up and a few
moments later Marion found herself beneath
the homespun coverlids, staring up at the
brown beams and dreaming that they were
being slowly transformed into shining trenches
filled with Confederate gold.</p>
<p>Black Blevens was not long in carrying
his election war into every quarter. The
summer school at once became a center of
fire. At this time the free summer school
was more than half over and, though neither
Florence nor Marion had taught in day
school before, they had met with singular
success. They had found these young feud
fighters regular storehouses of explosives,
but once the children came to know that
their teacher meant to deal justly with them
and that they had a deep and abiding love
for them, they had settled down to hard
study in a way quite remarkable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Now, on the Monday after the election
struggle had been determined upon, there
came a new pupil to the school. With two
battered books and a half of a tablet under
his arm, he marched to the teacher&rsquo;s desk
and announced his intentions of going to
school.</p>
<p>His manner was meek enough to disarm
the most wary of teachers. He was sixteen.
He was not badly dressed and an attempt
had been made to comb his unruly locks.
Only in his restless blue eyes did there lurk
a warning signal of danger.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s lips trembled ever so slightly
as she asked his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud for Buddington, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, jest Bud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bud,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s smile was a
doubtful one. She was beginning to suspect
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud Wax,&rdquo; the boy added reluctantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Florence started. She had feared this. Bud
Wax, known as the most troublesome boy
on Laurel Branch, a boy who had been
known to ride through the settlement at
midnight shouting like a wild Indian and firing
his pistol in air. And worst of all, he
was a distant relative of Black Blevens and
lived at his cabin.</p>
<p>What could be the answer? There could
be but one; he had been sent to make trouble.
If Black Blevens could break up the summer
school he could all the more easily convince
doubtful voters that these girls from the outside
were unqualified to handle the school.</p>
<p>For a moment she wavered. She could
refuse to admit him. The control of the
summer school was in her hands. Yet there
was no real reason to offer. Bud was larger
and older than most of the other children,
yet there were a few older than he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; she told herself as she set
her lips tight, &ldquo;to refuse to admit him is to
surrender without a battle. I won&rsquo;t surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>All this thinking took but a half dozen seconds.
At the end of that time she favored
the boy with her very best smile and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bud, you may have the seat by
the back window on the right side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the boy stared at her in
silence. A seat by a back window is at
once a much coveted place and a spot quite
advantageous for mischief making. Bud
knew this; yet this girl teacher gave him
this place. Just what his conclusions were
regarding this move Florence could not even
guess.</p>
<p>Every hour of that day seemed the hour
before a thunder storm. Every child in the
room knew why Bud was there; and while
as a whole they were friendly to their
teachers, they were at the same time normal
children. And where is the child who does
not long for excitement.</p>
<p>The day passed as others had. The slow
drone of bees outside, the murmur of voices
reciting lessons, loud shouts of play at noon
and recess, then the glad burst of joy as the
sixty children went racing home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bud was just like the rest,&rdquo; Florence said
to Ransom Turner that evening. &ldquo;Perhaps
there&rsquo;s nothing wrong after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait!&rdquo; Ransom said with a shake
of his head. &ldquo;Old Black Blevens ain&rsquo;t sendin&rsquo;
that boy to school fer book larnin&rsquo;. Hit&rsquo;s
time for layin&rsquo; by of the corn. Took him
right outen&rsquo; the field, he did. Don&rsquo;t make
sense, that ar don&rsquo;t, unless he hopes Bud&rsquo;ll
make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence went to bed with a headache.
Doubtless Ransom was right. She was
tempted to wish that they had never started
the fight, that they had left Black Blevens
and Al Finley to collect their ill gotten school
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the children without an education!&rdquo;
she whispered fiercely. &ldquo;No! Never! Never!
We&rsquo;ll fight, and by all that&rsquo;s good, we&rsquo;ll
win!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>A whole week passed and nothing unusual
happened. If Bud Wax and Black Blevens
meant any harm they were taking a long
time to tamp powder and lay fuse. All Ransom
would say was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest you mind what I say. That Black
Blevens is a plumb quare worker, but he&rsquo;s always
at hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two little rumors came to Florence. A
small child had told her that Bud carried his
pistol to school. An older boy had said that
Bud was trying to pick a quarrel with Ballard
Skidmore. Ballard was larger and older
than Bud, a big, slow-going, red-headed fellow
who somehow reminded Florence of a
St. Bernard dog. She put little faith in either
of these rumors, and as for picking a quarrel
with this slow-going fellow, she did not believe
it could be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>On Saturday something vaguely disturbing
occurred. There were many squirrels
on the upper slopes of Little Black Mountain.
Ralph had taught Florence how to shoot with
his long barreled .22 pistol. She decided to
try her hand at hunting. Had it not been
Marion&rsquo;s day for helping with the work she
would have asked her to go along. As it
was, she struck away alone over the tortuous
cow path that led to the upper reaches
of the mountain.</p>
<p>Having donned a pair of canvas knickers,
high boots and an old hunting coat, she
was prepared for a free, rough time of it.
Free and rough it was, too. Brambles tore
at her, rocks slid from beneath her feet to
send her sprawling, a rotten tree trunk over
which she was climbing suddenly caved in
and threatened to send her rolling down the
mountain. She enjoyed it all. A typical
American girl, strong and brave, born for
the out-of-doors, she took the buffets of
nature and laughed in its face.</p>
<p>As she reached a higher elevation the slope
became gentler. Here she found an abundance
of beach and chestnut trees, and higher
up a grove of walnut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Hardly had she reached the edge of the
walnut grove when she caught a flash of
red, then a scolding chatter from a tall tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A squirrel,&rdquo; she breathed as she silently
lifted the hammer of her long pistol. &ldquo;I
wonder&mdash;I just wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her wonderings were cut short by a sudden
thud close by, then another. Two frisking
squirrels had come to the ground within
a dozen paces of her. Like a flash of light
they were away over the moss and up another
tree. This tree was not large and the
leaves were scanty. On tip-toe she stalked it.</p>
<p>Gazing intently upward, she discovered a
pair of small black eyes looking down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted the shiny barrel, but at that
instant the eyes vanished.</p>
<p>Off to the right she caught a chatter.
Then, just as she went tip-toeing away, a
half-grown walnut dropped at her feet. She
picked it up. The shell had been half eaten
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saucy things!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shaking
her fist in mock anger at the frolickers.</p>
<p>With eyes wandering everywhere, tip-toeing,
listening, pausing for a moment to start
quickly away, she at last crossed over into
a grove of chestnuts.</p>
<p>All this time the inside of her pistol&rsquo;s barrel
remained as shiny as when she started.
Always, as she prepared to shoot, she caught
a shrill chatter or saw the flash of a bushy
tail. It was great fun, so she went on with
it until at last, quite tired out, she flung herself
down beneath a great chestnut tree to
half bury herself in green and gray moss as
soft as a velvet cushion. There, flat on her
back, breathing the fresh mountain air, listening
to the songs of forest birds far and
near, catching the distant melodious tink-tank
of cow bells, squinting at the flash of
sunlight as it played among the leaves, she
at last drifted off into a dreamy sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>She did not sleep long, but when she awoke
she was conscious of some living creature
near her. Then she heard a thump-thump
among the leaves, followed by a scratching
sound. Without the least sound, she moved
her head from side to side. Then she saw
him, an inquisitive red squirrel. He was sitting
on a stump, not ten feet away, staring
at her. Instantly her hand was on her pistol,
but she did not lift it. Instead, she rolled
over and lifted up her head to look again.</p>
<p>The squirrel had retreated a little, but had
mounted another stump for a second look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How easy!&rdquo; she thought, silently gripping
her pistol.</p>
<p>There came a rustle from the right, then
one at the left. The ground was alive with
squirrels who had made a party of it and had
come for a look at this sleeping nymph of
the woods. She caught the gleam of their
peering eyes from leaf pile, low bush, stump
and fallen trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she whispered at last. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
kill one of you. Not one. But it&rsquo;s been heaps
of fun to hunt you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>At that she sat up and began shaking the
dead leaves from her hair. Instantly her
furry visitors vanished.</p>
<p>But what was that? She caught a sound
of heavier movements in the leaves.</p>
<p>Instantly she was on her knees, peering
through the bushes. What could it have
been? Surely not a squirrel. Too heavy for
that. There it was again! Rustle! Rustle!
Rustle!</p>
<p>Then again there was silence, a silence that
was frightening. The girl felt the hair rising
at the back of her neck. She was alone on
the mountain. Was it a bear? There were
bears on the mountain. Was it a man? An
enemy?</p>
<p>As she glanced about she realized with a
little burst of fright that, like sparrows at
sight of a hawk, the squirrels had vanished.
This indeed was an ominous token.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she thrust her long
barreled pistol into an inside pocket of her
jacket, where it could be snatched out at a
moment&rsquo;s notice. Yet, even as she did this,
she realized how absurd a weapon is a long
barrelled .22 when one faces real danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>For a moment, standing like a wild deer,
poised on tip-toe ready for instant flight, she
stood there listening. All she heard was the
wild beating of her own heart and the faint
tink-tank of cow bells in the valley below.</p>
<p>The sound of these bells increased her fear.
Their very faintness told her the distance
she had wandered away over the mountain.</p>
<p>The next moment, walking on tip-toe,
scarcely breathing, with her pistol snugly hidden
in her coat, she was making good her
retreat.</p>
<p>It was not until Monday morning that the
real truth of this mountain experience came
to her. Then it came with a suddenness and
force that was strong enough to bowl over
even a man of strong heart.</p>
<p>She was on her way to school when Ransom
Turner, having called her into the store
and closed the door, said in a low husky tone
that told her of deep feeling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a warrant out for your arrest, but
don&rsquo;t you care narry bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my arrest?&rdquo; Florence stared. &ldquo;What
have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s for carryin&rsquo; concealed weapons, a
pistol gun, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl paused and caught her breath. It
all came to her like a flash. Those stealthy
movements on the mountain had been made
by some of Black Blevens&rsquo; men. They had
been spying on her. She blushed as she realized
that they might have seen her sleeping
there in the leaves. But her face was flushed
with anger as she realized that, having seen
her pocket that all but harmless pistol, they
had taken a mean advantage and had sworn
out a warrant for her arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you keer,&rdquo; said the little mountain
man, putting a hand on her arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you keer narry bit. This store&rsquo;s mine, an&rsquo; all
them goods. I&rsquo;ll mortgage hit all to go your
bond. You go right on teaching your school.
We&rsquo;ll take keer of old Black Blevens and all
them of his sort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Quick tears blinded her, but she brushed
them away. It was hard to be treated as
a criminal in a strange land and by the very
people you were trying to help.</p>
<p>Quickly, instead of tears, there was a gleam
of battle in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat it!&rdquo; said Ransom, clinching
his fists hard. &ldquo;Down here in the mountings
law&rsquo;s a club to beat your enemies with. Hit&rsquo;s
quare, but hit&rsquo;s true. We&rsquo;ll git a lawyer from
the court house. We&rsquo;ll beat old Black Blevens,
just you wait and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three times more that morning Florence
was reduced to tears by rough-clad, shuffling
mountaineers who came to knock timidly at
the schoolhouse door and to assure her that
they had heard of her plight and were ready
to go her bail and to help in any way. &ldquo;If
hit takes the roof off from over my ole
woman an&rsquo; the last hog shoat I got runnin&rsquo;
in the branch,&rdquo; as one of them expressed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>It is always good to know that one has
friends, and when one is among comparative
strangers it is gratifying indeed.</p>
<p>And yet, as the day came to an end and
the sudden mountain darkness fell, it found
Florence with a heavy heart. To be tried by
a Justice of the Peace for a crime, this was a
cross indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried by a Justice,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
&ldquo;Who is the Justice? Pellage Skidmore!
One of Black Blevens&rsquo; henchmen!
It&rsquo;s a plot. They&rsquo;ll fine me and let me go;
perhaps give me ten days in the county
jail. Ten days in that place!&rdquo; Her heart
stopped beating. She had seen that jail&mdash;a
dark and dirty place full of vermin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden a new thought came to
her. The least fine that could be imposed
was twenty-five dollars; one of the men had
told her that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the Constitution of the United States,&rdquo;
she whispered to herself, &ldquo;it says that in trials
over matters amounting to twenty-five dollars,
or over, the defendant may call for a
jury. I&rsquo;ll call for one. If I must have a
trial, I&rsquo;ll have a real one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she stamped the ground with her
foot and felt immensely relieved. There is a
great comfort to be had sometimes when one
has something to say about his own hanging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />THE SILENT WATCHER</h2>
<p>Troubles never come singly. Florence&rsquo;s
second shock came close on the heels of the
first. Having decided to make the best of
a bad situation and to allow her friends and
fellow clansmen to arrange the legal battle
over her trial for carrying a concealed
weapon, she went to her work next day
with a brave heart.</p>
<p>With all her strong resolves, the look on
the faces of her smaller charges came near
melting her to tears. All knew of the impending
trial. A few greeted her with a
glassy stare. These were children of her
enemies. For the most part they looked at
her with such a sad and sorrowful longing
as one might expect to find on the face of a
mother whose son has been ordered shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Marion said to her, &ldquo;being tried
by a jury in the mountains must be a solemn
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Florence, swallowing hard,
&ldquo;and Ransom Turner told me last night
this was the first time in the history of the
mountains that a woman has been tried for
carrying concealed weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great occasion!&rdquo; Marion could
see the humor of the situation. &ldquo;When is it
to come off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ransom says that the judge has set the
trial a week from next Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s school election day. All Laurel
Branch will be there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come!&rdquo; said Florence, a gleam
of fire in her eye. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything
to be ashamed of! They want a fight. We&rsquo;ll
give them one&mdash;a battle royal! They&rsquo;ve already
lost one point; they must give me a
jury. We&rsquo;ll make them lose some more. I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the tide would turn and
the power that is higher than I would turn
this bit of meanness and trickery to our
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>The forenoon of that day passed much as
had the earlier hours of other days&mdash;study and
lessons, recess, then again the droning of
voices blended with the lazy buzzing of flies
and the distant songs of birds.</p>
<p>In spite of the quiet smoothness of the
passing hours, there was in the air that
ominous tenseness which one feels but cannot
explain.</p>
<p>This was heightened fourfold by a strange
occurrence. Just as Florence was about to
ring the bell after the noon hour, Marion
drew her to a gaping window that looked out
on the upper landscape and pointed with a
trembling finger to a solitary figure perched
atop a giant sandstone rock that lay in the
center of a deserted clearing a few hundred
yards above the schoolhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The figure was that of a mountaineer. At
that distance it would have been difficult to
have told whether he was young or old.
Something about the way he sat slouching
over the rifle that lay across his lap reminded
Florence of Black Blevens. An involuntary
shudder shook her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Lookout Rock!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>The story of that rock they knew too
well. In earlier days, when a deadly feud
was raging up and down the creek, this rock
had been the lookout for Black Blevens&rsquo; clan.
There, on top of the rock, with rifle at his
side, a clansman would watch the movements
of his enemy. Smoke curling from a distant
chimney, a woman hoeing corn in the field,
the distant boom of a rifle, all were signs
that he read and passed on by signals to his
distant clansmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been a watcher on that rock
for years, they say,&rdquo; said Florence. Her
teeth were fairly chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! He&rsquo;s looking this way. Seems that
he must be expecting something to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Florence stood trembling, all unnerved for
one instant. Then, having shaken herself
as one will to awaken from an unpleasant
dream, she became her brave self again.</p>
<p>It was well she regained her courage. Fifteen
minutes later, while Marion was outside
beneath a great beech tree, hearing a lesson,
Florence sat watching over a study hour. On
hearing a sound of commotion she looked up
quickly to see her fifty children running for
doors and windows. In the back of the room
Bud Wax and Ballard Skidmore stood glaring
at each other and reaching for their hip
pockets.</p>
<p>One instant the teacher&rsquo;s head whirled. The
next that dread rumor sped through her
brain: &ldquo;Bud has been carrying his pistol
gun to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a powerful mechanical thing,
she went into action. One instant she had
leaped from the platform; the next found
her half way down the aisle. Before the slow
muscles of Bud&rsquo;s arm had carried a hand to
his pocket, he felt both wrists held in a
vice-like grip and a voice that was strange,
even to the speaker herself, said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard Skidmore, leave the room. All
the rest of you take your seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Bud Wax possessed the will power
to struggle, he would have found himself
powerless in this girl&rsquo;s grasp. Nature had
endowed her with a magnificent physique.
She had neither neglected it nor abused it.
Gym, when there was gym, hiking, climbing,
rowing, riding, had served to keep her fit
for this moment.</p>
<p>As Bud sank weakly to his seat he felt
something slide from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pistol gun,&rdquo; his paralized mind registered
weakly. The next moment he saw the
teacher gripping the butt of that magnificent
thing of black rubber and blue steel and
marching toward the front of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Jordon,&rdquo; she said as she tried to
still the wild beating of her heart, &ldquo;go bring
me two sandstones as large as your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mam.&rdquo; James went out trembling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Florence calmly tilted out the cylinder of
the gun and allowed the cartridges to fall out.
After that she stood with the weapon dangling
in her hand.</p>
<p>When the rocks had been placed on her
desk she laid the pistol on the flattest one,
then lifted the other for a blow.</p>
<p>She did not look at Bud. She dared not.
When a small child she had possessed a doll
that was all her own. A ruthless hand had
broken the doll&rsquo;s head. No doll ever meant
more to a girl than his first gun meant to a
mountain boy.</p>
<p>Without looking, she felt the agony on the
boy&rsquo;s face as the stone descended. Without
listening she heard him crumple in his seat
as the rubber grip broke, springs flew and
the barrel bent.</p>
<p>When there remained only an unrecognizable
mass of broken and twisted steel, she
walked slowly to the open window and
dropped it out. Turning, she looked them all
squarely in the eye (all but Bud, whose face
was down on his desk) and said in her ordinary
tune of voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may resume your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one corner a fly, caught in a spider&rsquo;s
web, droned complainingly. From a nearby
bush there came the liquid notes of a wild
canary, while faint and from far away there
came the low of a cow. Save for the occasional
swish of a turned page, no other sound
disturbed the Sabbath-like stillness of the
school room. And, as Florence&rsquo;s glance
strayed to the hillside and sentinal rock, she
saw that the silent watcher was gone.</p>
<p>Had Florence been able to open the book
of the future and to read there an account
of the far reaching events that were to come
out of the moments that had just passed, she
would have been surprised and startled. As
she could not, she could only wonder, and in
her heart there was a feeling of dread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>The hours that followed were filled with
a strange, subdued silence. The careless
rustle of pages was gone. Gone, too, was the
uneasy shuffle of feet on the plain board
floor. Children recited in tones little above a
whisper. It was as if the room were empty;
no children there. And yet, there they were.
Florence saw them with her eyes, but when
she closed her eyes she was subject to an illusion,
a feeling that they had vanished.</p>
<p>When the last long hours had dragged its
way to a weary end, the children crept silently
away. On the soft soil their bare feet made
no sound, and from their lips there came
never a whisper.</p>
<p>Bud Wax was the last to leave and looking
neither to right nor left, with his head
upon his breast he disappeared at once in the
shadows of a paw-paw thicket.</p>
<p>Marion had gone ahead with some of the
younger children to help them across the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Florence remained behind. As the last
child disappeared from sight, she left the
schoolhouse to strike off up the leafy bank
and on up the hillside until, quite out of
breath from climbing, she threw herself upon
a soft bed of ferns to bury her face in her
hands and burst out crying.</p>
<p>As she lay there pressing her throbbing
temples, it seemed to her that all worth
while things in the world had passed away.
Being only a girl, she could not fathom the
depth of emotion nor measure the flood
tide of bitterness that flowed over her soul.
She only knew that at last memory came
to her rescue, the memory of an old, old
story in the Bible of a man who, having won
a marvelous victory over great odds, had
gone far away into the wilderness to at last
throw himself prostrate upon the ground and
ask that he might die.</p>
<p>As the girl recalled the story she felt that
she had much in common with this old
prophet of Israel. The enemy of her school
had tried to destroy it. She had defeated his
end. How long she would remain victor she
could not tell. She only knew that to-day
she had won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to-day,&rdquo; she assured herself stoutly,
&ldquo;is enough. Let to-morrow care for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she recalled a promise.
She had told Jensie Crider, one of her most
promising pupils, that she would come to her
house and stay the night. She must be away
at once.</p>
<p>An hour later found her on the shake
roofed porch of a two room cabin far up on
the side of Big Black Mountain. The light
faded from the tallest, most distant peak as
her tiny young hostess bade her shy welcome.</p>
<p>To one accustomed, as Florence was, to
the homes of rich and fertile valleys, this
mountain cabin seemed strangely meager.
Two rooms, two beds, a table of pine boards,
a fireplace hung with rows of red peppers
and braids of onions, three splint bottomed
chairs, a pile of home woven coverlids in the
corner, a box cupboard nailed to the wall, a
few dishes in the cupboard, that was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>And yet it was scrupulously clean. The
hearth had been brushed, the floor scrubbed
and sanded, the coverlids on the beds were
spotless and the few cheap stone dishes shone
like imported china.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that people from the outside
don&rsquo;t realize,&rdquo; Florence told herself.
&ldquo;Many of these mountain folks, living here
shut off from the world, with few tools and
many difficulties, would put to shame many
of those whose opportunities have been great.
Surely their children should have a chance!
And they shall!&rdquo; She clenched her hands
tight as this thought passed through her
mind. She was thinking of the coming
school election and of the things they would
do if they won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we win?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We will
win! We will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One incident of the evening in that cabin
remained long in her memory. They were at
supper. Since there were but four plates
and four chairs, the two younger children
must wait while Jensie ate with her teacher
and the father and mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The meal was simple enough&mdash;corn bread
baked on the hearth, fried string beans, a
glass of wild cherry jelly and a plain cake
with very little sugar. The luxury of the
meal was a plate of boiled eggs. On the
rich, broad-sweeping prairies, or in cities, one
thinks of eggs as staple food. In the mountains
they are hoarded as a golden treasure,
to be traded at the store for calico, shoes, and
other necessities of life.</p>
<p>But this night, in honor of the guest, Jensie
had served six shining white eggs. Florence
saw the faces of the children glow with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably haven&rsquo;t had eggs for months,&rdquo;
was her mental comment.</p>
<p>As she took her egg and cut it in two
with her knife, it was like the breaking of
bread in sacrament.</p>
<p>As the meal was eaten she watched the
eager eyes of the two waiting children. Then,
of a sudden, in the eyes of those little ones,
a near tragedy occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have another egg,&rdquo; said the hostess to
Florence, passing the plate as she did so.</p>
<p>Without thinking, she put out a hand to
take one. Then, of a sudden, the youngest
child threw herself flat on the floor while her
little form shook with silent sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I care for another,&rdquo;
Florence said quickly, drawing back her hand
just in time.</p>
<p>At once, with face wreathed in smiles, the
little one was on her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do this for me,&rdquo; thought Florence,
swallowing hard. &ldquo;What must I not do for
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock found Florence safely tucked
away in the bed which occupied a corner of
the small living room. In the kitchen-living
room slept her host and his good wife, while
from above her there came an occasional
rustle or thump that told plainer than words
that the three children, having given up their
bed to the teacher, had gone to sleep on the
floor of the attic. Here was one more token
of the unusual hospitality of these kindly
mountain people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The ceiling, at which the girl lay staring
with sleepless eyes, was strange indeed. In
some way Jeff Crider had obtained enough
mill sawed boards to cover the rough hewn
beams. Some way, too, he had obtained
enough paint to cover the boards. Then, that
he might produce a decorative effect, before
the paint was dry he had held a smoking,
globeless kerosene lamp close to the paint,
and, moving about in ever widening circles,
had painted there black roads that led round
and round in endless ways to nowhere.</p>
<p>As the girl stared at this fantastic ceiling
it seemed to her that these tracings should
mean something, that they led to an important
truth, a truth that she should know, and
one of vast importance.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden it struck her all of a
heap. This cabin had an attic. Mrs. McAlpin&rsquo;s
whipsawed cabin must have one, too.
There was no entrance from below. She was
sure of that, but the attic was there all the
same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confederate gold,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It
must be hidden there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So intense were her convictions on this
subject that she found herself unable to
sleep.</p>
<p>At last, having wrapped a homespun
blanket about her, she stepped into the crisp
air of the night.</p>
<p>The moon was just rising over Big Black
Mountain. It was lighting up the scenes of
another entrancing mystery, which Florence
had stumbled upon a few days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives at the head of Laurel Branch?&rdquo;
she had asked Ransom Turner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there ain&rsquo;t nobody that rightly
knows except them that lives there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peers like there don&rsquo;t nobody rightly
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How very strange!&rdquo; she had exclaimed.
&ldquo;When did they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby two years back. Came from
somewhere away over back of Pine Mounting.
Quarest people you most ever seed. One
man half as big as a mounting, and no arm
except one. Mighty onfriendly folks. Coupla
men who went up thar huntin&rsquo; got scared
off. Quarest folks you most ever seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s where little Hallie came
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be. But if I was you I&rsquo;d never go
near thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ransom had gone on to tell weird tales of
these strange people, a dozen families in all
who had leased land from a coal company
and had gone up there beyond a natural stone
gateway which appeared to shut them from
the rest of the world. He had told how they
had stayed there, never coming down to the
settlements for barter and trade, and how
they kept other mountain people away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Other tales he had told, too; tales that had
made her blood run cold. There was the
story of a peddler with a pack who had gone
up there at nightfall and had never been seen
to return, and a one-armed fiddler who had
never come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t they have gone out some
other way?&rdquo; she had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Narry a pass at the head of this branch,
narry a one. Jest rocky ridges, so steep an&rsquo;
high that if you was to drop your hat from
the top it would blow back up to you. No,
Miss,&rdquo; he had added with a shake of his
head, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you never go up thar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet she had somehow felt that she
must and would go through the natural gateway
to the little known valley of mystery.</p>
<p>Now, as she stood looking at the moon that
shone down upon it all, she felt the lure
stronger than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I will go up
there. I feel sure that I must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Little did she dream, as she stood there
until the chill night air drove her inside,
that in less than a week up there at the head
of Laurel Branch she was to enter upon the
strangest, most mysterious adventure of her
young life.</p>
<p>Before she fell asleep she wondered a little
about the strange experiences that had come
to her on Ages Creek. Would she ever know
why they had made her prisoner there? When
would the title be proved up on the Powell
coal tract? Would it ever be? Would they
get the commission?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />BEYOND FORBIDDEN PORTALS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Billie, has the whipsawed house an
attic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence asked the question eagerly as she
met her venerable friend on the creek road
next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough! Now has it? I most forgit.&rdquo;
The old man scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t a stairway, nor an opening for
a ladder, but there must be space up there,
and if there&rsquo;s space there must be something
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shore there are. Cobwebs, dust, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&rdquo;
the old man, startled with a sudden
thought, almost lost his balance and fell
over, &ldquo;an&rsquo; of course that ar Confederate gold.
Shore enough. Whar else could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come over at five this afternoon
and we&rsquo;ll explore that place,&rdquo; smiled Florence.
&ldquo;That is, if Mrs. McAlpin will permit us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shore be thar at the apinted hour&mdash;sun
time,&rdquo; Uncle Billie beamed like an excited
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plum quare gold it were,&rdquo; he added as
Florence hurried away to school.</p>
<p>At sight of the old log schoolhouse, all
thoughts of the fabled gold were driven from
her mind. The responsibilities of the day
came flooding in upon her. What had been
the results of yesterday&rsquo;s affair? She had
asked Marion to visit Ballard Skidmore in
his home and get his story of the quarrel
with Bud Wax. She did not doubt but that
Bud had been entirely in the wrong, and
hoped Ballard would return to school. Bud,
of course, she would never see in her school
room again. Somewhat to her surprise, she
found herself regretting this. There was
much good in the boy. She had grown rather
fond of the sight of his restless blue eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only he did not belong, body and soul,
to Black Blevens,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;one
might make something of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her mind went to work on the problems
directly before her. How had Black
Blevens taken the affair yesterday? Had he
been the silent watcher on Lookout Rock?
What had this setting of a watch meant?
What would his next move be?</p>
<p>And what of the coming election? Would
there be enough voters to enable them to
win? Ransom Turner had promised to make
a canvas of the community and tell her how
matters stood.</p>
<p>Her trial? Her heart sank at thought of
it! To be tried by a jury with all the mountain
people looking on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all for them, for the little ones,&rdquo;
she whispered, and was comforted.</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise when, upon entering
the school yard, she saw Bud Wax with the
larger boys, pitching rocks at a stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d come back,&rdquo; she
whispered to Marion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Ballard coming back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they fight again?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s heart
was in her throat. She felt that another day
such as yesterday would prove her undoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard said he&rsquo;d do his best. Bud had
been teasing him for a long time. He called
him a name that no mountain man or boy
will allow himself to be called. Then Ballard
struck him in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time Florence pondered the problem
of further punishment for Bud. In the end
she concluded that any punishment after the
destruction of his pistol would be anticlimax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; she told
Marion. &ldquo;But keep your eyes open for
further trouble. Why did he come back
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>That day Bud was a model pupil. Quiet,
far too quiet for comfort, he studied hard and
recited perfectly. The day passed as a model
in the history of the school. Florence went
home more puzzled than ever. On the doorstep
of the whipsawed house she found Uncle
Billie Gibson. He was smiling his brightest
smile and glancing up at the eaves as if he
expected a shower of gold to come rattling
down from the shingles.</p>
<p>A moment later two breathless young ladies
were eagerly begging Mrs. McAlpin for permission
to remove a board from the ceiling
of their room that they might explore the
attic of that venerable house.</p>
<p>Consent of the good lady was readily obtained
and in a twinkle, armed with a wood
chisel and hammer, they were at the job.</p>
<p>Have you never entered an old house whose
attic has remained unexplored for years?
Then you have never enjoyed the exciting
dreams that come with thoughts of treasures
that may be found there. Chests filled with
curios from many lands; ancient trunks packed
with rare old laces; a grandfather&rsquo;s clock;
rare old books worth a fortune; period furniture
that a millionaire might covet. Indeed,
who knows what rare treasures may be hidden
there?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>As for the two girls and Uncle Billie, they
were looking for but one treasure&mdash;a stack
of yellow gold.</p>
<p>As Florence inserted the chisel in a crack
and gave it a pull there came such a screech
from the ancient hand-hammered nails as
brought a scream of fright from Marion. The
next moment the board gave way with a
suddenness that all but knocked Florence
from the chair upon which she was perched
and showered her with an accumulation of
aged dust. With a shrill cry she leaped to
the floor.</p>
<p>Over their heads, as they regained composure,
they saw a broad, black, gaping hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark up there,&rdquo; said Marion with a little
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to use a flashlight.&rdquo; Florence dug
down into her trunk. &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battery&rsquo;s dead. Have to use a candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A candle was brought. Then while Marion
sat on the chair, Florence climbed the back
of it and thrust her head and shoulders
through the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; Marion asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a&mdash;yes, there&rsquo;s something, a
black bulk over there in the corner. It&rsquo;s
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chest, of course!&rdquo; Marion was quite
beside herself with excitement. Without
thinking she sprang to her feet. The next
instant the chair toppled over and Florence,
lighted candle and all, came crashing down
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did you do that for?&rdquo; she
demanded, once she had regained the breath
that had been knocked from her by the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I forgot!&rdquo; said Marion. &ldquo;Truly I&rsquo;m
sorry. Let&rsquo;s try again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; said Florence, rubbing
her bruises. &ldquo;The bed will be better. Come
on, let&rsquo;s push it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bed was soon under the hole and a
moment later the two girls, closely followed
by an agile old man, were creeping from
beam to beam toward the bulk in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s the chest of gold,&rdquo; whispered
Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;someway it don&rsquo;t look right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoo-ee!&rdquo; chuckled Uncle Billie. &ldquo;That
ain&rsquo;t no chest. That&rsquo;s a poundin&rsquo; mill. What
hit&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; stored up here is more&rsquo;n I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pounding mill? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded
Florence as she held her candle above
a great cylindrical block of wood on which
there rested a similar block of smaller dimensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poundin&rsquo; mill&rsquo;s used for poundin&rsquo; out
corn meal. They ain&rsquo;t used now on account
o&rsquo; water wheels, but they was a powerful
help in their day. You all never seed &rsquo;em
work? Well, hit&rsquo;s this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Uncle Billie lifted the smaller cylinder and
dropped it into a hole in the larger block,
which was some three feet high and four
feet across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put your corn in that there holler,
then you tie this block to a saplin&rsquo; to help you
teeter hit up an&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; you pound your
corn until it are meal. That&rsquo;s all there are
to hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a powerful heavy block!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
trying to tip it. &ldquo;Must be made
out o&rsquo; first growth hickory, as sizeable as hit
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s our gold?&rdquo; asked Marion.
Her voice dropped off into a little disappointed
wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peers to me like we&rsquo;d been barkin&rsquo; up
the wrong tree,&rdquo; said Uncle Billie with a
sad shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be hidden around somewhere
among the rafters,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a good look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>They explored the attic thoroughly. Not
a pile of dust but was disturbed that day.
Their only reward was a rusty Civil War
canteen that, as Uncle Billie expressed it,
was &ldquo;as empty as a bear after a winter&rsquo;s
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they were preparing to descend,
Marion made an interesting find. Having noticed
a circular spot on the dust covered
boards that might have been a knot, she
put out a hand to pick up a circular disk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly.
&ldquo;How heavy it is! It&mdash;why, it must be
gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit shore are!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Billie,
taking it from her and rubbing it clean on
his ragged trousers&rsquo; leg. &ldquo;Hit sure are. Hit&rsquo;s
one of them are pieces of Confederate gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t say Confederate,&rdquo; whispered
Florence after examining it closely.
&ldquo;It says on one side &lsquo;Georgia gold&rsquo;, and on
the other&mdash;let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; With a trembling
finger she rubbed away the last vestige of
dust. &ldquo;It says: &lsquo;T-e-m-p-l-e R-e-i-d. Temple
Reid, Ten Dollars&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Georgia Gold. Temple Reid. Ten Dollars!&rdquo;
exclaimed Marion. &ldquo;What nonsense!
How could a man coin money? Money is
made by nations, not by men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what it says,&rdquo; insisted Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, it isn&rsquo;t Confederate gold,&rdquo;
said Marion, disappointment creeping into
her tone. There had been a glamor of romance
in her hope of finding some coins
struck by that long since dissolved government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t most always tell,&rdquo; said Uncle
Billie with a wise shake of his head. &ldquo;That
ar&rsquo;s Georgia gold. But hit&rsquo;s jest one. There
were a hundred, mebby four-five hundred.
Stands to reason some was Confederate, fer
hadn&rsquo;t Jeff Middelton come from right down
thar whar that sort of money were made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Billie&rsquo;s logic seemed weak, but, that
they might not hurt the feelings of the good
old man, the girls let it pass. They all adjourned
to the rooms below. Dust and dirt
were scrubbed off, the hole was nailed up,
and there the matter stood, closed for the
time being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>One thing was decided upon. The strange
gold piece was to be sent to a curator of
Field Museum, who was a friend of Marion.
He would be able to tell them the origin of
the piece, and its value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one coin may be of considerable
value,&rdquo; said Marion. &ldquo;There are coins
worth hundreds of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it may be worth just exactly
its weight in gold,&rdquo; laughed Florence. &ldquo;But
send it along. It will do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the bit of gold went North in
the registered mail pouch, and the girls, forgetting
their disappointment as quickly as
possible, set about two important tasks that
lay just before them; the winning of the
school election and preparation for Florence&rsquo;s
trial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>It was five days later. It was evening, but
there was no sunset. Dull, gray clouds had
hung low on the mountains all day. Dull
clouds of disappointment and defeat hung
heavily on Florence&rsquo;s spirits. She had taken
a long, long walk up Laurel Branch. Her
hopes that this walk would revive her drooping
spirits had proven vain. Each leaden mile
had found her head drooping more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; she murmured as she marched
stolidly on.</p>
<p>It was true; at least Ransom Turner had
assured her it was. The school election was
lost. Each side had begun work early. The
canvass had been taken; the line-up, in so far
as anyone could tell, was completed, and at
the present Black Blevens and his choice for
teacher, Al Finely, were eight votes ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight votes!&rdquo; she had said to Ransom.
&ldquo;How can we overcome that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; Ransom had said.
&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s a fact. That Black Blevens is the
election fightenest man I most ever seed.
We&rsquo;re jest as good as licked right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Florence said to herself as,
undecided whether to pause for rest or to
wander aimlessly on, she paused beside a
great flat rock, &ldquo;it does seem that there is a
way to win if only we knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as if in answer to her worrying problem,
the fog lifted, revealing before her in
startling clearness the natural gateway that
led to the horseshoe valley at the head of
Laurel Branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;The gateway
to that mysterious valley where strange people
live without visiting the outside world, the
valley from which men do not return!&rdquo; Her
heart was all a-tremble. Her shaking knees
obliged her to drop suddenly upon an inviting
rock.</p>
<p>At once her keen mind was at work. She
had come farther than she thought and she
should turn back at once. Then, too, that
gateway held for her an irresistible fascination.
Did she hope from this point of vantage
to catch some glimpse of the life of those
strange beings who lived beyond the gate?
Was some good angel whispering to her soul
some of the hidden things of the future?
Who can say? Enough that she sat there
alone while the dull shadows deepened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>It did not seem strange to her that her
thoughts at this moment should turn to the
little girl, Hallie, who had been so mysteriously
thrust into the life that centered in
the old whipsawed house. Indeed, she had
often enough associated her with this same
stone gateway and had wondered if after all
she had been brought through this very portal
to the outside world.</p>
<p>Wherever she may have come from, Hallie
had grown to be the life of that old brown
cabin. She had come to them dressed in a
water-soaked scarlet dress and a mud smeared
tam that shone bright even in their terrible
disarray. The bright colors had suited her so
well that they had dressed her so ever since.
Closing her eyes, Florence could see her now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like a scarlet bird fluttering from branch
to branch of an old tree,&rdquo; she mused as she
saw her moving from room to room. &ldquo;How
we&rsquo;d miss her if someone came for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise when upon opening
her eyes she saw, not twenty yards before
her, down the creek, the very person of whom
she had been thinking.</p>
<p>Suppressing a cry of surprise, she waited
and watched. Walking slowly, as if in a
trance, Hallie passed within four feet of her
without seeing her, then marched straight on
toward the rocky gateway that lay between
her and the hidden valley.</p>
<p>At once Florence&rsquo;s mind was in a whirl.
Her lips parted to call the child back, but no
sound came forth.</p>
<p>What should she do? Evidently something
had happened to the child. She was in
a daze again. Perhaps the old fever that had
wiped out her memory had returned. Had
memory accompanied it? Was she now
groping her way back to her own home?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; Florence spoke the word softly.
Home had meant so much to her. Like a
moving panorama she saw before her twilight
scenes at home by the fireplace, bed time and
prayer beside her bed with her mother bending
over, joyous mornings and sunny afternoons.
Home! Ah, yes, home! And perhaps
this little girl was going home. Could
she stop her? And yet, could she allow
her to wander alone in the gathering darkness
through those forbidding portals?</p>
<p>The answer came quickly. She dropped
down into the path, turned toward the stone
gateway, then marched steadily forward until
both she and the child were lost to view beyond
the rocky pillars.</p>
<p>Had Florence chanced to look behind she
might have caught sight of a person following
at a distance. A skulking figure it was
that moved by quick starts and stops from
shadow to shadow. And, had her backward
glance been rightly timed, had it come as a
sudden last feeble burst of sunlight illumined
his face, she would have seen that this person
was Bud Wax.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Had she seen him her heart would doubtless
have been filled with misgivings and wild
questions. Why was the boy following her?
Was this a trap? What did he know about
little Hallie? What of the land beyond the
forbidden gateway?</p>
<p>Since she did not look behind her, but
walked straight on, she asked herself no
such questions. So the three passed into the
mysterious beyond, the child as in a dream,
the teacher sturdily on duty bound, the boy
skulking from shadow to shadow. Hardly
had they disappeared when sudden night
came down to close the gate with a curtain
of darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />A MYSTERIOUS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Have you ever stepped out into a night
so dark that you could scarcely see your
hand before you, and have you, after taking a
few steps from your own doorstep, tried to
imagine that you were alone in the dark in
lands that were strange to you? If you
have, then you can imagine the feeling of
Florence as she moved forward into the
unknown. Scarcely had the second hand on
her watch ticked round three times than she
found it necessary to follow the child by
sound rather than by sight. Such is the
darkness that at times fills rockbound mountain
valleys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>So, tripping over rocks, splashing into
spring fed pools, slipping on damp moss, she
made her way forward. Always following the
child, always followed by the skulking figure
of the boy, she came at last to a sudden turn
in the road, and there, just before her, shone
a mellow square of yellow light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A home!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>At that instant there came the baying challenge
of a hound. He was joined by two
others, and at once the hills were roaring
with echoes of their clamor.</p>
<p>For a second Florence stood there trembling,
irresolute. Her mind worked rapidly.
To flee would be folly. There was no escaping
those roaring beasts. The treatment she
might hope to receive from her bitterest
enemy would be better. At once, having decided
this question, she dashed toward the
light.</p>
<p>Hardly had she gone a dozen paces when,
with a little cry of surprise and terror, she
stumbled over something soft and yielding,
then went down sprawling.</p>
<p>At once she was on hand and knees, feeling
for the thing that had tripped her. In a second
her hands were upon it. Not another
second was needed to tell her what it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hallie,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Hallie! What
has happened? Hallie! Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the form beside her neither answered
nor moved.</p>
<p>In desperation she groped about her for
a stone. Having found two of the right
size, she crouched there like a panther beside
her wounded young. At the same time, in
as steady a tone as she could command, she
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, you! Call off your dogs! Do
you want them to murder an innocent
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One instant there came a flood of light
from a large door, the next the light was
blocked by the form of the largest man
Florence had ever seen, and there came such a
giant&rsquo;s roar as quite drowned the baying of
the dogs and set the rocks fairly shaking
with echoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The echoes died away and the dogs were
silent. The giant did not speak again, but
stood there peering into the darkness. The
girl caught the snap-snap of a bat&rsquo;s jaws as
he flew over. She heard the steady tick of
her watch. Then of a sudden there came a
movement close behind her. Wheeling about,
she tried to peer into the darkness but saw
nothing. There came no other sound.</p>
<p>So a moment passed on into eternity, and
yet another. Then the giant&rsquo;s voice boomed
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever y&rsquo; be, come! Them hounds
won&rsquo;t harm you narry bit. There&rsquo;s chill
and right smart of mounting fever in the
night air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising unsteadily, a great fear tugging at
her heart, Florence lifted the child in her
arms and stumbled along toward the doorway.</p>
<p>As she came nearer, the man turned to
speak a word to someone inside and at once
the light from within brought out his profile
in clear relief. A massive, full-bearded face it
was, with a powerful jaw, a large hawk-like
nose, and a full forehead. All this was
crowned by a tangled mass of iron gray hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Two other facts the girl noted with a
shudder. The giant&rsquo;s right sleeve hung limp
at his side; in his powerful left arm he held a
rifle of gigantic proportions which might suit
equally well for either firearm or club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one-armed giant that Ransom
Turner told about!&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
more frightened than ever.</p>
<p>Yet, mindful of the good of the child who
lay limp in her arms, she trudged sturdily on
until the light from the doorway fell full
upon her.</p>
<p>Instantly, at sight of them, a change came
over the man&rsquo;s face. The ruddy touch to his
cheek turned to ashen. He tottered as if
for a fall but, gripping the doorpost, he held
his ground and continued his glassy stare
until at last words escaped his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s Hallie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Then, and not till then, did Florence know
that she had brought the child to her home.</p>
<p>But the giant? The moment his force of
will had loosed his tongue, like some lion
who stunned by a shot comes back to life,
he became a terrifying creature of tremendous
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;They killed
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; said Florence in as calm
a tone as she could command. &ldquo;Let me
by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically the giant moved to one side.</p>
<p>As Florence stepped into the room she
took in the interior at a glance. It was the
largest room she had seen in the mountains
and its walls were of logs. The cracks were
well chinked. The floor was clean and the
wooden table, on which rested three large
candles, was scrubbed to a snowy whiteness.
Two beds in a corner were well in order. A
burned down fire glowed dully in a broad
fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>In the corner by the fireplace stood two
women; one tall and young, with the sturdy
erectness of her kind; the other bent with
age. They had risen from their chairs and
were pointing at the child in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve killed her!&rdquo; the giant roared
again. The working of his face in rage or
sorrow was a terrible thing to see. &ldquo;You
have killed her. Hit&rsquo;s enough. Give her to
me.&rdquo; He gripped Florence&rsquo;s arm in a way
that brought white lines of pain to her face.</p>
<p>At that instant an astonishing thing happened.
A body hurdling through the doorway
struck the giant amidship and sent him
bowling over like a ten-pin. As he fell he
crashed into the table and overturned it.
The three candles cut circles through the air,
then sputtered out, leaving the place in darkness.</p>
<p>At once Florence&rsquo;s head was in a whirl.
What should she do? Try to escape? Perhaps.
But where was the door? She had lost
her sense of direction. As she took a step
forward her foot caught in some garment
and, loosing her hold on the child, she fell
heavily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Stunned by the fall, she lay motionless.
As her wandering senses returned she became
conscious of the beings about her. She
caught the heavy breathing of the old man.
No sound came from the corner by the fire.
Like all those of their race, the mountain
women were neither whining nor sobbing
over this sudden commotion in their home,
but stood stolidly waiting the next surprising
turn of fortune&rsquo;s wheel.</p>
<p>Darkness continued. Two red coals on the
hearth glowed like eyes, but gave forth no
light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Florence listened, she heard
the sharp drawn breath of one in pain.</p>
<p>Who could this be? The person who had
leaped through the door? Perhaps, but who
was he?</p>
<p>All these wandering thoughts were put to
flight by the sudden wail of a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s Hallie,&rdquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice from
the corner. &ldquo;She hain&rsquo;t dead. Not near.
Betsy Anne, make a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence heard a shuffle in that corner,
sensed a groping in the dark, then saw a
trembling tube of paper thrust against one
of the live coals. At once the coal began to
brighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone blowing it,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Five seconds later the tube burst into
bright flame, throwing fantastic shadows
over the room. A few seconds more and
a candle was found. It illumined the cabin
with a faint but steady light.</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing whether to flee or stay,
Florence glanced hurriedly around her. The
giant, having risen to his knees, was bending
over the child who was now silently sobbing.
The two women were standing nearby
and in the corner was the last person Florence
had expected to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud Wax!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Then catching the look of pain on his
face, she said with a look of compassion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess it&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; said the boy,
touching the arm that hung limp at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought he&rsquo;d hurt you, and I&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it for me! You&mdash;&rdquo; Florence
was beginning to understand, or at least to
wonder. Bud had done this&mdash;Bud, of all
persons. Kin of her bitterest enemy, the boy
whose choicest possession she had destroyed!
And how had he come to be here at that
moment? Her head was in a whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s right smart of a rock right outside
the door,&rdquo; the boy grinned. &ldquo;I were
a watchin&rsquo; from up there an&rsquo; when I seed
him grab yore arm I just naturally jumped. I
reckon hit were to far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if your arm is broken, it must be
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>At that moment there was a sound of
shuffling feet at the door. Turning about,
Florence found herself staring into the face
of a man, a face she recognized instantly.
The beady eyes, hooked nose, unshaven chin&mdash;there
could be no mistaking him. It was
he who had twice frightened Marion and
at one time all but driven little Hallie into
hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more could happen in one crowded
night?&rdquo; she asked herself, deep in despair.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Bud Wax was the one
person in the room who brought her comfort.
Oddly enough, too, the person she feared most
was the one she saw for the first time that
very moment, the man at the door.</p>
<p>Even as she stared at this man with a
fascination born of fear, the man spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you all so shook up about?&rdquo; he
drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s Hallie,&rdquo; the grizzled old man said,
running his hand across his brow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
come back. They brung her back. Might
nigh kilt her, I reckon, then brung her back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s lips parted in denial, but no
words came out. Her tongue seemed glued
to the roof of her mouth. There she sat,
staring dumbly, while a cheap nickel plated
alarm clock on the mantelpiece rattled loudly
away as if running a race with time, and
faintly, from far away, there came the notes
of some bird calling to his mate in the night.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>At this moment, back in the whipsawed
cabin, Marion found herself at once highly
elated and greatly depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can find the rest of them&mdash;a
whole sack of them!&rdquo; she whispered excitedly
to herself one moment, and the next
found herself pacing the floor, murmuring:
&ldquo;Where can they have gone? Why don&rsquo;t
they come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no connection between the two
emotions which she was experiencing. The
first had to do with a letter which had just
been brought to her from the little postoffice
down the creek; the last with the mysterious
disappearance of Florence and Hallie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>The letter was from her friend, the curator
at Field Museum. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Marion:</p>
<p>You have made quite a find. How did
you happen upon it? But then, I suppose
one may find many rare articles
back there in the Cumberlands so far
from the main channels of commerce and
life.</p>
<p>The gold piece you sent me is not
properly a coin, but a token minted by
a private individual. There are enough
such tokens in bronze, but the gold ones
are rare. Just why any were made is
hard to tell. We know they were made,
however. Two kinds are known to exist;
one made in Georgia, the other in
North Carolina.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but way back
in 1830 gold was mined in Lumpkin
County, Georgia, and Rutherfordton,
North Carolina. Temple Reid, of Georgia,
and a Mr. Bechtler of Rutherfordton,
made their gold into tokens and the
specimen you have found is a true sample
of Georgia gold, very rare and quite valuable.
Should you care to sell this one,
and should you find others, I have no
doubt they might be readily disposed of
at something like sixty or seventy dollars
for each piece.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty or seventy dollars!&rdquo; Marion exclaimed
as she read the letter for a third
time. &ldquo;At that rate a mere handful of them
would be worth quite a small fortune, and
even the price of one is not to be sneered at.
It would help toward repairing the schoolhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. McAlpin.
&ldquo;That schoolhouse needs a new roof, a new
floor, doors, windows, blackboards and seats.
Otherwise it is a very good schoolhouse. But
then, what is the use of your dreaming about
that? Ransom Turner says the election is
lost, and he should know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he should.&rdquo; A cloud spread over
Marion&rsquo;s face as she sat down. The cloud
was replaced by a frown as she sprang to her
feet to pace the floor and exclaim for the
fourth time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can they have gone? Why don&rsquo;t
they come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs. McAlpin,
&ldquo;that they went together to a cabin for
supper or to spend the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They&mdash;Florence and Hallie&mdash;had indeed
gone to a cabin to spend the night; but such
a cabin, and such a night!</p>
<p>Marion knew that Mrs. McAlpin did not
feel half the assurance she tried to express.
Little Hallie had disappeared, leaving no
trail behind. Florence had left the whipsawed
cabin, saying she was going for a
walk but would return for supper. She had
not returned. Darkness had come, supper
time had passed. Their supper stood untouched
and cold on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still have hopes of finding the rest of
that Georgia gold,&rdquo; said Marion, talking more
to herself than to Mrs. McAlpin. &ldquo;Perhaps
it isn&rsquo;t all Georgia gold. There may be some
Confederate gold mixed in with it. One
never can tell. It certainly would be thrilling
to discover some real Confederate gold.
I&rsquo;m not at all satisfied with our search of the
attic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there anything up there beside this
one bit of gold?&rdquo; On Mrs. McAlpin&rsquo;s face
there was such an amused smile as one might
expect to find there had a child told her he
meant to go in search of the pot of gold at
the foot of the rainbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a heavy old pounding mill,&rdquo;
replied Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should one wish to store a pounding
mill in an attic? They are always used
out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the girl thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Might be sort of an heirloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather ponderous I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Marion caught her breath. Uncle Billie
had said that old block of a pounding mill
was uncommonly heavy. Here was food for
thought. The first thing in the morning she
would go up there. She would&mdash;</p>
<p>At this moment her thoughts were cut
short by a sudden burst of thunder that went
rolling and reverberating down the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a storm!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
dashing toward the door.</p>
<p>They were in for a storm indeed; such a
storm as had not been known on Laurel
Branch in years. For an hour Marion sat
by the doorway watching the play of lightning
as it flashed from peak to peak on Big
Black Mountain. The deafening peals of
thunder, like the roar of gigantic cannons in
some endless battle, came rumbling down
from the hills to shake the very cabin floor.
Through all this one thought was uppermost
in Marion&rsquo;s mind, one question repeated itself
again and again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Florence and little Hallie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE GUARD OF THE STONE GATEWAY</h2>
<p>At the very moment when Marion was wondering
and worrying about her pal, Florence
was learning how truly one might trust the
providence of God.</p>
<p>Being cornered, with the grizzled giant before
her accusing her of &ldquo;might nigh killing&rdquo;
little Hallie, and with the beady-eyed
individual, whom she feared most of all,
blocking the door before her, and with Bud
Wax, whom she had always thought of as a
member of the enemy&rsquo;s clan, groaning with
pain in the corner, she had reached the point
of utter distraction when of a sudden the
man in the doorway spoke.</p>
<p>He had just been told that little Hallie
had returned home, &ldquo;might nigh killed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking first
at the one-armed giant and then at Florence.
&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t narry a word of truth in what you
just been saying, Job Creech. Them thar
folks never hurt Hallie. They never teched
one hair on her head. They was plumb kind
an&rsquo; gentle with her. I been watchin&rsquo;. I
knowed whar she was. She was so pert and
contented hit were a shame to tote her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could have more surprised Florence
than this speech; nothing could have
more quickly released her pent-up powers and
set her brain working on the needs of the
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t nobody been totin&rsquo; Hallie back,&rdquo;
grumbled the giant. &ldquo;This here fureign lady
brung her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not hear this speech. She was
already bending over the silently sobbing
child. After loosening her clothes, she chafed
her cold hands and feet until a warm red
glow returned to them; then, picking her up,
she placed her on the bed and covered her
in home woven blankets. In less than a
minute Hallie fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right when she wakens,&rdquo;
Florence smiled reassuringly at the younger
woman, who she thought might be the little
girl&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;When she wakes up she
may even recognize you all. I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stared at her as if she had
spoken to them in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Disregarding this, she turned to the man
at the door. &ldquo;This boy has broken his arm,&rdquo;
she said, nodding at Bud. &ldquo;It will have to
be set. Have you anything that will do for
splints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon thar&rsquo;s right smart of shakes
outen the shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you get me some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man disappeared.</p>
<p>After a search she found in the corner an
old, faded calico dress which was quite clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will do for binding,&rdquo; she said, looking
at the women. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind if I
use it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no account noways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was obliged to hurt Bud severely while
getting the bone in place and binding it, but
the boy uttered never a groan.</p>
<p>By the time this task was completed, finding
herself quite shaky and weak, Florence
somehow made her way to a splint-bottomed
chair by the fire. Fresh fuel had been put on.
In spite of the deluge of water that now and
again came dashing down the chimney, the
fire burned brightly. The thunder storm was
now in full progress. Florence was surprised
at noting this.</p>
<p>So preoccupied had she been with her errands
of mercy that she had neither heard
nor seen anything of it until this moment.</p>
<p>Strange indeed were her thoughts as she
sat there staring at the fire. At times it was
the fire itself that held her attention. Led
on by the challenge of wind and storm, it
went roaring and laughing up the chimney,
for all the world as if it meant to dispel the
damp and cold from every cabin in the mountains.
A moment later, slapped squarely in
the face by a deluge of rain, it shrunk down
within itself until the whole cabin was in
darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s given up,&rdquo; Florence would whisper
to herself with a half sob. &ldquo;But no!
There it is rising from its own blackened
ruins to roar with cheer again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like life,&rdquo; she told herself. And, indeed,
how like her own life it was. Only a
few days before she had been fired with
hope and desire to be of service to these
mountain people. Now, with hopes drowned
and courage well nigh gone, she waited only
to battle her way through the coming trial
and the election that seemed certain defeat.
A lump rose in her throat at the thought.</p>
<p>But again, as the fire battling its way once
more up the chimney flung free its challenge
to the elements, she was driven to believe
that courage, hope and desire to serve would
again burn brightly in her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What hope can
there be? The election is lost! The winter
school a thing of the past. How can it be
otherwise? And yet I do hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These thoughts passed. She had become
suddenly conscious of her immediate surroundings.
She was well within the natural
stone gateway through which entrance had
been forbidden heretofore. She was in the
midst of a strange and mysterious people, in
the very cabin of their leader. Of this last
she felt sure.</p>
<p>She recalled with a sudden shock the weird
tales she had heard told of these people, of
the peddler with his rich pack of linens and
box of jewelry, and of the one-armed fiddler
who had passed this way to be seen no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I am here,&rdquo; she whispered, her
limbs trembling with terror. &ldquo;And on such
a night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Even as she spoke there came such a rolling
crash of thunder as set the dishes in the little
wall cupboard rattling and brought a huge
cross-log on the fire down with a thud and
sputter that sent sparks flying everywhere.
She caught the rush of water outside, not
alone the constant beating of the rain, but
louder and more terrifying than that, the
mighty rush and roar of a cataract. Swollen
to twenty times its natural size, Laurel Creek
had become a mighty Niagara.</p>
<p>Turning about, she allowed her gaze to
sweep the room. In one corner on a bed
little Hallie slept peacefully. In the opposite
corner the man with the hooked nose had
thrown himself across the other bed. The
two women had vanished, probably into the
other room of the cabin. In the corner, with
head pillowed on his uninjured arm, Bud
Wax slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look to be such a bad fellow,&rdquo;
Florence told herself. And so he didn&rsquo;t. On
his face there was such an expression as
one might expect to find upon the countenance
of one who, having lived through a
long and hard fought battle for self and self
interests, had at last found peace in service
for another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Florence read the look pictured there, but
she could not account for it. She could not
guess why the boy was there at all, nor why
he had made the attack that had resulted in
the broken arm. It was all very strange and
puzzling.</p>
<p>Strangest of all was the thing the one-armed
giant was engaged in at that particular
moment. On a small chair that emphasized
his hugeness, with head bent low and
lips constantly moving, he sat whispering
over an old Bible, spelling out the words one
by one. As the fire regained courage to do
its best, lighting up his aged face with a
sort of halo, the girl thought she had never
seen upon any face before a look so restful,
benevolent and benign.</p>
<p>At that moment a hand touched her shoulder.
She turned about and found herself
looking into the wrinkled face of the old
woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought y&rsquo; might like to lay down a
spell,&rdquo; she said, jerking her thumb toward
a door that led to the other room.</p>
<p>Without a word Florence followed her and,
fifteen minutes later, buried beneath a pile
of home woven coverlids, she lay lost in
dreamless sleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Marion sat upon a bed of moss well up the
side of Big Black Mountain. Three days had
passed since the mysterious disappearance of
Florence and little Hallie, three days of tormenting
anxiety. Every creek and runway
had been searched, but to no purpose. They
had vanished as completely as they might
had the earth swallowed them up.</p>
<p>Only one spot remained to be searched&mdash;the
head of Laurel Creek, beyond the natural
gateway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have gone up there,&rdquo; Mrs.
McAlpin had said in a tone of deep conviction.
&ldquo;Florence knew well enough the reputation
of those strange people. Nothing
could have induced her to pass that forbidden
barrier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Not satisfied with this, Marion had gone
to Ransom Turner about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s past reason!&rdquo; he said emphatically.
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the killingest folks in the mountains.
That&rsquo;s a fact, though they&rsquo;ve never
been made to stand trial. She&rsquo;d never dare
to go up there. An&rsquo; besides, if hit were best
to go there to search, you&rsquo;d have to git you
up half the men in these here mountains, and
there&rsquo;d sure be a big fight right thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the other hillsides had been searched
and the tongues of local gossipers had
wagged incessantly. Bitter enemies had it
that, seeing herself defeated in the coming
election and being ashamed or afraid to stand
trial for carrying concealed weapons, the girl
had fled in the night and had taken the child
with her to the &ldquo;Outside.&rdquo; All this, they
argued, was known well enough by Mrs.
McAlpin and Marion, but they did not care
to admit it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>In spite of all this, Ransom Turner and
Marion had continued, almost against hope,
to carry on the election fight. Black Blevens
had sent word to Lige Howard up on Pounding
Mill Creek that his mortgage would be
foreclosed if he and his three boys did not
promise to come down on election day and
vote for him as trustee. Ransom Turner, on
hearing this had sent word to Lige that
his mortgage would be taken care of&mdash;that
he was to vote for the best man.</p>
<p>Mary Anne Kelly, a niece of Black Blevens,
who lived down at the mouth of Ages Creek,
sent word to her fiance, Buckner Creech, that
if he did not vote right she would break her
engagement. That had put Buckner on the
doubtful list. Pole Cawood&rsquo;s wife, who was
a daughter of Black Blevens, threatened to
leave him and his four small children if he
did not vote for her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; said Marion, rubbing her forehead
with a groan, &ldquo;is a school election in
the Cumberlands. Nothing is too low or
mean if only it helps to gain an advantage.
We have fought fair, and lost, as far as I
can see. Ransom says we will lack ten or
twelve votes, and he doesn&rsquo;t know where we
can find a single other one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, with the cheerful optimism of
youth, the girl still hoped against hope and
looked forward with some eagerness the coming
of to-morrow and the election.</p>
<p>Needless to say, with worry over Florence
and Hallie, and interest in the election, she
had found neither time nor interest for further
exploration of the attic nor a search for
Jeff Middleton&rsquo;s treasure.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Strange were the circumstances that had
held Florence within the forbidden gates
these three long days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>She had wakened with a start on the morning
following the storm and her strange experiences
in the cabin. The sun, streaming
through a small window, had awakened her.
At first she had been utterly unable to account
for her strange surroundings. Then,
like a flash, it all came to her. The aged
giant, Bud Wax with his arm in a sling, the
women, the other man, little Hallie, the
storm,&mdash;all the strange and mysterious doings
of the night flashed through her mind
and left her wondering.</p>
<p>The very window through which the sunlight
streamed suggested mystery. Whence
had it come? These mysterious people who
lived beyond the stone gateway had come
from below, had travelled up Laurel Creek
and had not come back to the settlement.
Where had the glass for the window come
from? Had it been taken from some older
cabin? This log cabin seemed quite new.
Had these strange people some hidden trail
to the outside world? Ransom Turner had
said there was no mountain pass at the head
of Laurel Branch. Could it be possible that
he was wrong?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>All the wondering was cut short by
thought of little Hallie. How was she? Had
consciousness returned? Perhaps she needed
care at this very moment.</p>
<p>With this thought uppermost in her mind,
Florence sprang from her bed, drew on her
outer garments, then pushed open the door
that led to the other room.</p>
<p>She found Hallie feverish, and somewhat
delirious. Upon discovering this, without
begging leave of her strange host and with
not one thought for her own safety, she set
herself about the task of bringing the bloom
of health back to the child&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>The people about her brought the things
she asked for, then stood or sat quietly about
as they might had she been a doctor.</p>
<p>During the course of the day some twenty
men and women, and quite as many children,
came to peek shyly in at the door, or to enter
and sit whispering together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More people in this neighborhood than
one would think,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s mental
comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>A day came and went. Hallie improved
slightly. The next day she was so much
better that Florence took time for a stroll
out of doors. It was then that she received
something of a shock. Having wandered
down the creek trail until she was near to
the stone gateway, she saw a tall, gaunt,
young mountaineer step out into the path.
With a rifle over his arm, he began to pace
back and forth like a sentry on duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
&ldquo;if he would let me pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no desire to leave without taking
Hallie, she did not try, but deep in her heart
was the conviction that for some strange reason
she was virtually a prisoner within those
gates.</p>
<p>At once her mind was rife with speculation.
Who were these people? What had
they to fear from contact with the outside
world? Were they moonshiners? She had
heard much of mountain moonshine stills
before she came to the Cumberlands. If they
were moonshiners, where had they sold the
product of their stills?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it couldn&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; she shook her
head.</p>
<p>Were they a band of robbers? If so, whom
did they rob? She thought of the peddler
and the one-armed fiddler, and shuddered.</p>
<p>Still, as she thought of it now, she had seen
very little in these cabins that could have
come from a peddler&rsquo;s pack. The bare-topped
wooden tables were innocent of linen. Towels
were made of coarse, hand-woven linen.
The women wore no jewelry such as might
have come from a peddler&rsquo;s black box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very strange and mysterious,&rdquo; she
said with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>Only one thing came to her clearly as she
returned to the cabin&mdash;she must remain beside
little Hallie until she was out of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question she could not answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE MYSTERY TRAIL</h2>
<p>As Florence halted in her upward march
she felt herself overawed by a terrible sense
of desolation. For an hour she had traveled
over the most silent, lonely trail her feet had
ever trod. Little more than a footpath,
possible mayhap to a sure-footed horse, the
trail wound up and up and up toward the
point where the green of forest ended in
massive crags of limestone. She was now
among the crags.</p>
<p>Far away on the opposite mountainside the
sun was still shining, but on this trail there
fell neither sunlight nor form of shadow.
The north slope lay bathed in the perpetual
chill of a cheerless autumn. No sound came
to her from above, not a whisper from below.
Beneath her feet was solid rock, above her
more rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she asked herself as
she stood there irresolute. &ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t
be a pass. There just couldn&rsquo;t. Yet it seems
there must be! And some way, some way,
I must escape! To-morrow is my trial. To
fail to appear is to face disgrace. Besides,
there are my faithful friends, my bondsmen.
I must not fail them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, with an eagerness born of despair,
she pressed forward.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, the day before the trial.
Three days has passed since she had entered
the forbidden portals of the rock made gateway.
Little Hallie was now so far recovered
that she at this moment sat wrapped in a
blanket, smiling at the flames in the great
fireplace. Yes, Hallie was all right now, but
she, Florence, was in trouble. It was necessary
that she return to the settlement. But
how was she to do it? Three times that day
she had approached the stone gateway. Each
time the silent sentinel had appeared, treading
his monotonous watch before the trail.
She had not mustered up the courage to ask
him to let her pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be another trail, a pass over
the mountains at the head of the creek,&rdquo; she
had told herself. So, before the day had
half gone, she had walked slowly up the creek
trail until far beyond sight of the farthest
cabin. Then she had quickened her pace almost
to a run.</p>
<p>One thing she had seen in passing the
cabins had surprised her not a little. As she
rounded a corner she had caught a gleam of
white and had at once recognized the forms
of three persons standing in the shadows of
a great pine. Two were men, one a grown
boy. That boy, there could be no mistake,
was Bud Wax. The white she had seen was
the wrappings on his arm, which was still in
a sling.</p>
<p>With his back to her he was so engrossed
in the conversation which he was carrying
on with the other man that he did not so
much as see her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>From that distance she caught only fragments
of the talk. As the boy&rsquo;s voice rose
shrill and high, almost as if in anger, she
heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s your bounden duty. That&rsquo;s what
hit are! Look what she&rsquo;s been doin&rsquo;.
Look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here she passed behind a clump of
young pines which muffled the sound of his
voice.</p>
<p>As she pushed on through the deepening
shadows she thought of this and wondered
deeply. Bud had disappeared before she was
up that first morning. She had always supposed
that he had escaped to his home in
the darkness of night and storm. But here
he was. What was she to make of that?
Why had he come in the first place? Why
had he stayed? Was he, also, virtually their
prisoner? Or had he gone out and returned
for a reason? What was his feeling toward
her? There had been times during that last
week of school that she had surprised on his
face a look almost of admiration. The look
had vanished so quickly that she had doubted
its existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>And that night? Why had he leaped at
the one-armed giant when he put out a hand
to seize her? It looked like a desire to protect
her. But why? Was he not from the
camp of the enemy&mdash;Black Blevens&rsquo; camp?
Had she not destroyed his most priceless
possession, hammered it to bits between two
rocks? What could she think?</p>
<p>Her thoughts were suddenly cut short.
Before a wall of stone that towered a hundred
feet in air, she had come to the end
of the trail.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, all unknown to Marion
and Mrs. McAlpin, a clan was gathering at
the mouth of Laurel Branch. It was Ransom
Turner&rsquo;s clan. A strangely silent, uncommunicative
people, the mountaineers of
the Cumberlands seldom confide fully in
those who have but late come to live among
them. Ransom Turner and the men of his
clan had not confided their suspicions, nor
even all that they knew about Florence&rsquo;s
strange disappearance, to either Marion nor
Mrs. McAlpin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Having always suspected that the mysterious
child, Hallie, had somehow strayed beyond
the portals of the gate that led to the
head of the creek, and that she belonged to
that silent, forbidden land beyond, they had
assumed that she had found her way back
to her home.</p>
<p>That Florence had followed Hallie beyond
the gate, they had suspected at once. As
time passed and she did not return, this
suspicion, aided by certain rumors that came
to their ears, became a conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s up there she are!&rdquo; Ransom Turner
had been heard to whisper more than once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit certain are!&rdquo; came with a nod of
wise heads for answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Now it was the day before Florence&rsquo;s trial,
and the school election as well. Ransom&rsquo;s
men did not like the stinging remarks that
came from the camp of Black Blevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s the trial,&rdquo; Ransom had said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bound to be here. Go tell the boys to
git up their rifles an&rsquo; pistol guns an&rsquo; come
here at sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said to a trusty henchman, who
was away at once. In a small clearing a little
way up the side of Big Black Mountain,
a clearing completely surrounded by thickets
of laurel and mountain ivy, the men were
now straying in to drop silently down upon
the grass.</p>
<p>A grim, silent group they were. Here was a
lanky, long-bearded patriarch with a squirrel
rifle that stood as tall as he, and here a boy
of sixteen with a shiny modern rifle. Here
were dark-bearded, middle-aged men with
leather holsters buckled to their belts.</p>
<p>Conversation was all in whispers. One
caught but fragments of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s whar she are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s plumb quare about Bud Wax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will they fight, you reckon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud&rsquo;s been home once, I hearn tell. Hit&rsquo;s
what Bud said that made Ransom so sartin
about her bein&rsquo; up thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the whispering went on and more men
straggled in as the shadows fell.</p>
<p>The people at the mouth of Laurel Branch
had always resented the presence of their
mysterious neighbors beyond the stone gateway.
To a certain degree, also, they had
feared them. Things mysterious inspire terror.
Tales of their strange doings had not
grown smaller in their telling. The one-armed
giant had become a veritable Cyclops.
The beady-eyed stranger, who had once or
twice been seen beyond the gates, was a man
of strangely magic power. Such were the
yarns that had been spun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>To-night, however, all these spells must
vanish before the demand of cold steel. To-morrow
was trial day and election day. Florence
was needed. She must be at the mouth
of Laurel Branch at sun up. They meant to
bring her home. As soon as darkness fell
these grim warriors of the hills meant to
march past that stone gateway. If a sentry
attempted to stop them he would be silenced.
They would ask the release of their teacher,
the one who had dared to stand and fight for
their rights and the rights of their little ones.
If they could secure her release by peaceable
means they would do it. If it meant a fight,
then a fight it would be.</p>
<p>And so, at the very hour when Florence
trudged up the dark and shadowy trail, the
clan was gathering.</p>
<p>As for Florence, as has been said, she had
come to what appeared to be a sudden end
of the trail. Before her was a towering wall
of rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>But a well trodden path, beaten hard by
the tread of hundreds who have passed that
way, does not end so abruptly. Like the
current of a sunken river, it must always go
somewhere. By a careful examination of
her surroundings, the girl found that certain
sandstone boulders that lay in jagged heaps
to the right of her were worn smooth. These
smooth spots, she reasoned, had been made
by human feet.</p>
<p>At once, with a bound, she was away up
this natural stairway. Up, up, up she climbed
till her heart thumped wildly and her head
whirled. Then, to her vast surprise, just as
she reached the topmost pinnacle she came
upon a black heap of coal and directly before
her a coal shaft yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coal mine!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disgust,
sinking down breathless upon a rock. &ldquo;I
have come all this way to find only a coal
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these mountains, this was no discovery.
The mountains were full of coal. There was
wanted only a railroad to make the country
rich. But to think that she had come all this
way in the hope of finding a way out, only
to find there was nothing left but to retrace
her steps and to choose between taking the
desperate chance of slipping past that pacing
guard in the dark or remaining quietly within
the gates until something happened that
would set her free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that last,&rdquo; she groaned, &ldquo;can never
be. Never! I must escape! I must not miss
my trial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the frenzy of this resolve she sprang to
her feet. But what was this? The moment&rsquo;s
rest and the cooling breeze had quieted her
heart. She could think more clearly. This
was no coal mine; could not be. A coal mine
at the top of the mountain, a mile by trail
from the nearest cabin? What folly! There
were veins of coal lower down. She had seen
them, and open coal mines, too, almost at the
cabin&rsquo;s door. What, then, could this mean?
Here was coal, a coal vein, and an open drift,
and yet it was not a mine.</p>
<p>Boldly she set a foot inside the dark
opening. At once her foot shot from beneath
her and she went sprawling. Only by
a desperate clutching at the ragged rocks at
her side was she prevented from gliding
downward into a dark, unknown abyss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Frightened, with hands lacerated by the
sudden gripping of the rocks, and with heart
beating wildly, she clung there panting until
her head cooled and she realized that she was
resting on a rocky step.</p>
<p>Drawing herself up, she found she was able
to sit in a comfortable position and gaze
about her. Just before her was utter darkness;
behind her was the fading light of day.</p>
<p>Groping about in her pocket, she found a
box of safety matches. Having lighted one
of these she held it far out before her. At
once her lips parted in an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>Before her, leading down, down, down, was
a rude stairway cut in solid rock. On either
side of the stairway were mine props, and
back of these were black walls of coal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>It was all clear to her in an instant; not
all, perhaps, but much. There were many
just such veins of coal as this in the rockiest
portions of the Cumberlands. She had heard
of them. After the ages had passed when
coal had been deposited upon the surface of
the earth and strata of earth and rocks piled
upon them, there had come some tremendous
disturbance of the earth&rsquo;s surface which had
tilted rocks and coal deposits as well, and this
was just such a vein.</p>
<p>There was nothing so strange about that,
but it was strange to find this natural stairway
leading downward to some regions unknown.</p>
<p>Just as her match flickered and went out
her eyes caught the gleam of something
white in a niche of the rock at her side. At
once she was fumbling eagerly for another
match.</p>
<p>To her consternation, in her excitement
she let the box drop from her fingers.</p>
<p>Bump, bump, bump, it went down the steps.
For an instant her heart stood still. Had it
gone on down? Was she left without a
light? She thought it had stopped on the
third step, but could not be sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Slowly, carefully, she felt her way over
the damp and slippery steps. One step, two,
three. She felt them over carefully. No
matches. Her heart sank. One more step,
a hasty groping in the dark, then a cry of
joy. She gripped the box.</p>
<p>The next moment the place was alight
with a reddish yellow glow, and the next instant,
standing up, she was grasping the
white object that had caught her eye. It
was one of four tallow candles that lay in a
rocky niche.</p>
<p>Holding her match to it, she had the joy
of seeing its wick sputter, then flame up.</p>
<p>One moment she hesitated. Then, putting
one of the candles in her pocket, and holding
another well before her, with a firm and
steady step she began the descent into the
mysterious cavern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A TENSE SITUATION</h2>
<p>It was mysterious, haunting, spectral. &ldquo;Like
going down into the tomb of some ancient
Egyptian king,&rdquo; Florence told herself as,
with candle held well out before her, and
every step carefully poised, she made her
way down the long stone stairway.</p>
<p>Black walls of coal were on either side.
Before these the mine props stood like grim
sentinels. The shadows of these, cast by the
flickering light of the candle, appeared to
take on life as they leaped, swaying and
dancing, against the dusky walls.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl caught her breath. A
puff of air had all but extinguished her
candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came from below, not from
above!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Scarcely had she made this astonishing discovery
when she rounded a curve in the stairway
and came in sight of a square of light.
This distant illumination, the natural light
of day, coming from the outside, seemed to
beckon her on.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden it all came to her. &ldquo;A
tunnel!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Not the entrance
to a mine, but a tunnel, a tunnel through this
narrow peak of the mountain. Oh, joy!
I&rsquo;ve found the way out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her eagerness she plunged down the
stone stairway at a rate which threatened to
send her pitching headlong. But sure-footed
athlete that she was, she kept her balance
and in another moment, panting, quite out of
breath, she threw herself upon a huge flat
rock that, lighted by the last rays of the
setting sun, seemed a nugget of pure gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The scene her eyes gazed upon was of
matchless beauty. The crests of the mountains,
still beamed upon by the setting sun,
glowed like so many domes of fire, while farther
down the lower hillsides and valleys
were shrouded in impenetrable shadows
broken only by the silver thread of a stream
that idled down a valley.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl sprang to her feet. The
whole thing had come to her in a flash.
Wishing to be left alone, the mysterious people
at the head of Laurel Branch had cut a
pass through the solid mountain peak at a
narrow place. They alone knew of it.
Through this pass they carried the produce
from their rough little farms to the coal
mines far, far below. There they bartered
them for shoes, salt, calico, and whatever
their meager existence demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;is the way
the missing peddler and the one-armed fiddler
have gone. Being wanderers by profession,
they have gone through this pass and
never been seen again by the people at the
mouth of Laurel Branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she exclaimed, quite overcome
by the thought, &ldquo;that means that these people
at the head of Laurel Branch are honest
folks. They are not robbers and murderers.
I had hoped it might be so. It did not seem
possible that old Job could sit there by the
fire, spelling out the words of his Bible, then
lay the grand old Book aside to go out robbing
and killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl did a strange thing. Relighting
her candle, she picked her way over the
rocks back to the entrance to the tunnel, then
slowly, with thoughtful mind and careful
tread, began ascending the stone stairway.
She was going back.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, down at the mouth of
Laurel Branch, in the heart of the laurel
thicket, the low murmur of voices increased
in volume. They were coming&mdash;the clan was
gathering. Gaunt old men with white beards
were there, men who had fought in the Civil
War; middle-aged men who had packed a
gun in the Anson-Rankin feud of twenty
years before; and beardless boys who had
never fired a shot except at squirrel or possum.
One name was on every tongue, that
of Florence Ormsby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>As for Florence, while the night shadows
darkened she was making her way down the
mountain trail, back to the cabin of old Job,
the one-armed giant.</p>
<p>Once there, she threw off her hat and coat
and drew up a chair to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et?&rdquo; the giant asked from his corner.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a snack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another shake, then again silence.</p>
<p>For a long while the nickel alarm clock
above the mantel raced against time and its
constant tick-tick was the only sound that
disturbed the Sabbath-like stillness.</p>
<p>At last the aged giant cleared his throat
with surprising difficulty, then spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it peers plumb quare to you all
that we all stay up here in these here mountains
this away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Florence did not answer. She merely bent
forward with an air of great expectancy on
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit might be quare. Then again it
mightn&rsquo;t. Listen, Miss, hit&rsquo;s like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then for fifteen minutes, in his inimitable
mountain dialect and drawl, the old man
poured into her eager ears a story of such
bitter battling for life, such a tale of feud
fighting, as she had never before dreamed of
hearing from human lips.</p>
<p>There were tales of stalwart men shot
down on their very doorsteps, of battles in
the night, of men carried from their homes
to be seen no more.</p>
<p>All this had happened somewhere in the
mountains, back of Big Black Mountain, beyond
Poor Fork, over Pine Mountain, then
back and still back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>When there remained but a remnant of
what had once been a powerful family, the
old giant, having heard of this vacant land
at the head of Laurel Branch, had at last
persuaded his followers to come here to live.
And that there might be no more battles and
bloodshed, they had shut themselves completely
out from other people of the mountains.
Only by a secret passage had they
come and gone, to trade and barter in the
valley below.</p>
<p>How strange life is! Even as this old man
was telling of their long search for peace
and how at last they had found it, forty men
and boys, grim, determined mountain folks
with rifles in hand, were marching upon the
stone gateway which had heretofore held
them back. It was Ransom Turner&rsquo;s clan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s this I hearn tell about?&rdquo; the
old giant exclaimed in a rumbling tone of
anger. &ldquo;What about them sorry people at
the mouth of the crick takin&rsquo; you up fer gun
totin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence started. So intense had been her
interest in the story that she had quite forgotten
her own troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re to try me to-morrow,&rdquo; she
faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fer gun totin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman? Fer gun totin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;Mounting folks have come tew that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this &rsquo;lection, this school &rsquo;lection,&rdquo; he
rumbled with a sudden change of subject.
&ldquo;How do you reckon about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to-morrow, too, and it&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hearn tell,&rdquo; the old man mused. &ldquo;So
I hearn tell. But you can&rsquo;t always reckon
right about these here things, kin you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was almost jocular freedom in the
old man&rsquo;s tones, something quite different
from his Moses-like dignity of other times.</p>
<p>Again his tone changed. It was tender
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been mighty nice and a right
smart help to us with little Hallie. I reckon
she&rsquo;s might nigh well now. I reckon as how
you might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The old man paused as if reluctant to say
the words that had forced their way to his
lips. Leaving the sentence unfinished, he
fumbled about in the corner for a poker.
Having found it, he gave the fire such a jabbing
as sent the sparks dancing by thousands
up the chimney.</p>
<p>There were watchers who saw those sparks
soaring skyward and wondered at them&mdash;forty
watchers, the men of Ransom Turner&rsquo;s
clan.</p>
<p>At that very moment, too, the guard behind
the stone gateway, catching the shuffle
of feet behind the thicket of paw-paws that
grew just outside the gate, caught his breath
hard and, shifting his rifle to the other arm,
dropped back into the deeper shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was about to remark,&rdquo; the old man
turned to Florence with a look of resolution
on his face, &ldquo;&rsquo;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no mite o&rsquo; sense in
keepin&rsquo; you here, not narry &rsquo;nother minute.
There&rsquo;s little Hallie, she&rsquo;s might nigh well.
There&rsquo;s that sorry trial to-morrow, an&rsquo; that
&rsquo;lection. They&rsquo;ll be ailing fer you down there
at the mouth of the creek, plumb ailin&rsquo;, so it&rsquo;s
fittin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;d go. You tell Zeb Howard
down thar by the gate that I sent you, and I
reckon he&rsquo;ll let you by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Florence caught her breath. She had heard
the old man&rsquo;s story. She was free. She
might go. For a moment, as a wild bird,
made captive for a day and then set free hesitates
before his first free flight, she sat there
in silence. Then, as if impelled by the sense
of impending peril and a great need, she
rose and hurried away.</p>
<p>Need enough there was, too. Her fleet feet
could not cover that distance too quickly, for
at that moment hot words were passing thick
and fast before the stone gateway.</p>
<p>As she paused in her sudden flight she
caught the sound of these angry voices. At
first indistinct, then growing louder as she
rounded a curve, she caught fragments of
sentences:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Narry a step.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hit are!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hit are
not!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Drop down the barrel of that ar
gun!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s plumb unnatural!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Then, having caught a hint of the meaning
of it all, she paused to strain her ears to catch
the lowest word. At that moment there
came the ominous click of a cartridge being
thrown into its place in a rifle barrel. This
sound came from within the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guard,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you all plain,&rdquo; there came from the
same spot a second later, &ldquo;we all don&rsquo;t mean
you all narry bit of harm. You all go on
back down that crick. The land down thar
belongs to you all. Up here it&rsquo;s ourn. Don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s have any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you, stranger,&rdquo; came in
an equally insistent voice, &ldquo;we all are goin&rsquo;
through. You are got someone up that we
want and are goin&rsquo; to git!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t narry one up yonder that&rsquo;s not
aimin&rsquo; to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys!&rdquo; Florence caught these
words spoken in low tones by a voice that
sounded familiar. The voice was terrifying
in its seriousness. &ldquo;We got to go in thar.
Hain&rsquo;t no other way. When I say the word
start comin&rsquo; on an&rsquo; firin&rsquo; as you come. He
can&rsquo;t git all of us. Mebby he won&rsquo;t get airy
one. &rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no use a talkin&rsquo; to him nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Florence caught her breath. Her heart
paused for a second, then went racing. Her
knees trembled. She had heard much of
mountain feud fights. Now she was about
to witness one. Worse than that, she must
be directly in the path of the bullets. At
realization of this she wanted to flee, but her
feet would not obey her. So there she stood
as if rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>Though her feet were still, her brain was
racing. She had recognized the voice of the
last speaker, Ransom Turner. A good man
does not start a feud fight over a trifle. Why
had they come? Who was this person they
had come to demand? Was it a friend, or
some outlaw fleeing from justice? She did
not have long to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, strangers,&rdquo; came in calm
tones from within the gates. &ldquo;You kin get
me maybe&mdash;seem&rsquo;s how there&rsquo;s a army of
you&mdash;but count on it, I&rsquo;ll get a lot of you
first. I&rsquo;m the shootinest man as I reckon
has most ever made a crop on Laurel Branch.
But I&rsquo;m plumb peaceably minded, too. Hain&rsquo;t
rarin&rsquo; up fer no killin&rsquo;. Now what I wants
to know is, who might that air person be
that you all come after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough,&rdquo; drawled Ransom
Turner. &ldquo;But so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll know agin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll
tell you. Hit&rsquo;s our teacher, Florence Ormsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence Ormsby! The girl&rsquo;s own name
sounded strange to her. So they were risking
their lives to save her! And she was an
outsider! A great wave of dizziness came
over her. She fought it off. She tried to
speak. Her tongue clung to the roof of her
mouth. Powerless to move, she stood there
gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys! &rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no use foolin&rsquo;
further.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The grim tones of the doughty little leader
loosed the girl&rsquo;s tongue. Then, with tones
that were little less than shrieks, she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ransom! Ransom Turner! Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t
do it! I&rsquo;m here. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m coming
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this shouted speech that awoke shrill
echoes along the mountain side, there fell a
moment of breathless silence, such a silence
as is perhaps seldom felt save on a battlefield
after the declaration of a truce.</p>
<p>Then, in a tone that told of deeper emotional
struggle, there came from Ransom
Turner&rsquo;s lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you shore, Miss Florence? Are hit
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite all right,&rdquo; she said in as steady a
tone as she could command. &ldquo;See! I am
coming down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving quietly, she passed the last tall
pine, the last clump of rhododendrons within
the gate, then the massive portals, and
a moment later found herself among her own
people, free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Free! How good it seemed! And yet, as
between two silent mountaineers she walked
back to the settlement and the whipsawed
house, she felt the burdens of these simple
people come back to her shoulders like a
crushing weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The trial
and the election, and then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that night, after a joyous reunion
and a splendid supper in the whipsawed cabin,
she lay once more in her own bed, staring
up at the ceiling where the flashes of a dying
fire played. Then it was that she noted something
strange. The board they had once
taken from the ceiling that they might get
into the attic had been once more removed,
then replaced. She knew this, for this time
it had been put back with the ends reversed.</p>
<p>Vaguely her mind played with this thought.
Who had been up there? What had they
found? Georgia gold? Confederate gold?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>She wondered about the election; her trial;
Bud Wax. Wondered a little about Marion,
who had gone down the branch to stay all
night with Patience Madden, the oldest girl
in their school. Was she sleeping safely in
Patience&rsquo;s cabin? In this strange community
no one seemed quite safe.</p>
<p>She wondered a little about the deed for
the Powell coal land and the commission they
were to receive&mdash;sometime. When would
that be? She wondered if she would ever see
any of the men who had kidnapped her. Her
mental picture of them was very vivid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever saw them again I would know
them,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>At that she turned over and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The adventures of the night for Florence
were done; for Marion they were now about
to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />HALLIE KIDNAPPED</h2>
<p>Marion was wide awake. She lay beneath
home-woven blankets in Patience Madden&rsquo;s
cabin. The room was dark. It was night;
time for sleep. The mountain side was very
still. Even the stream, Pounding Mill Creek,
tumbling down Little Black Mountain, murmured
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should sleep,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;To-morrow
is the big day. Election. Trial.
One big day. Twenty-for hours must decide
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do coming events truly cast their shadows
before them, and do their shadows disturb
us, rob us of our sleep? However that may
be, Marion could not sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>At last, rising noiselessly, for Patience slept
peacefully in the narrow bed next to her own,
she threw a blanket over her shoulders and
stole out upon the porch. Here she dropped
into a rustic chair to sit staring dreamily at
the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old moon,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;what do you
see to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the moon answered her question she
would have sprung to her feet in alarm. As
it was, she sat quite still, sat there until with
a sudden start she caught the slow and steady
tramp of horses on the trail below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who can that be?&rdquo; she whispered
as she shrank far back into the shadows.</p>
<p>She was soon enough to know. Two horses
swung around a curve in the trail not five rods
from the cabin. At that instant the moon,
coming out from behind a filmy cloud, shone
full upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall slim man and a short one,&rdquo; she
thought to herself. &ldquo;Sounds vaguely familiar.
Where have I&mdash;&rdquo; She started suddenly.
Florence had told her of them. These
were the men who had held her prisoner
when she had gone to the back of Pine Mountain
to get an option on the Powell coal tract.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>A second shock following this one came
near knocking her from her chair. The tall
man carried a bundle&mdash;something wrapped
in a blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child,&rdquo; she whispered. A chill ran up
her spine. She hardly knew why.</p>
<p>A second later she knew. As the horses
wheeled sharply to avoid a great boulder that
lay against the trail, the face of the child,
lighted up by the moon, became plainly
visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Hallie!&rdquo; Marion exclaimed under
her breath.</p>
<p>In an instant she was out of her chair and
in the room shaking the mountain girl and
whispering hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience! Patience! Wake up! They&rsquo;ve
kidnapped little Hallie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where? Why?&rdquo; the mountain girl
stammered, still half asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Sinking down upon the bed and burying
her face in her hands, Marion tried to think.
Little Hallie had been kidnapped. Why?
For ransom? Nothing seemed more absurd.
Who would pay? The child had been poorly
dressed when she was brought to their cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Marion thought, &ldquo;what do we
really know of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught herself short up. This was no
time for speculation. What was to be done?
There were no men in the cabin. She was
alone with the sixteen year old mountain girl.
The nearest cabin was a half mile down the
creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;there are
no men here to follow them. They have kidnapped
little Hallie. They can&rsquo;t mean her
any good. Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the mountain girl sprang out
of the room and went racing down the stairs.</p>
<p>A lamp was lighted. Rough, serviceable
garments of khaki were scrambled into, shoes
were hurriedly laced. They were ready to
go when Marion thought of food. They
might be away for hours, perhaps days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Snatching down a bag she raced to the
kitchen, there to fill the bag with corn pone,
cold sweet potatoes, crackers, cookies and
cheese.</p>
<p>When she returned, to her astonishment
she found Patience calmly ramming home a
charge in the long-barreled squirrel rifle
which had hung over the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will it shoot?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you shoot it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain girl gave her a look of scorn.
&ldquo;In the mountains everyone shoots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo; There was warmth
in the girl&rsquo;s tone. There was comfort in
knowing that though there was no man in
their party, there was a rifle carried by a
girl who knew well how to handle it.</p>
<p>A moment more and they were feeling the
damp night air upon their cheeks. It was a
narrow trail they were following. Now
and then as they hurried forward the dew
drenched branch of dogwood or rhododendron
slapped them full in the face. Here
and there some wild creature, frightened from
the trail, went bounding away into the bush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>It was spooky enough, this climbing higher
and higher up the side of Little Black Mountain
in the dead of night. Spooky and dangerous,
too. What if those men, catching
the sound of their footsteps behind them,
should draw aside from the trail and waylay
them? Marion dared not dwell on this. One
thing was uppermost in her mind&mdash;the saving
of Little Hallie. How was this to be done?
She could not tell. The answer would be
there when the time came. At all hazards
the men must be followed.</p>
<p>So, drenched by dripping dew, torn at by
out-reaching brambles, catching the faint
tinge of waters in the gulch far below, they
ascended higher and higher until at last they
had reached the crest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; whispered Patience as they rested
here. &ldquo;There are Hallie&rsquo;s footprints!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>It was true. Having dismounted, that they
might rest their tired muscles, the men had
lifted the child to the ground.</p>
<p>Marion found comfort in this. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t
be entirely bad,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;They
think of the child&rsquo;s comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s rest, and they were away along
the trail that followed the ridge for some distance.</p>
<p>They marched along in silence until they
came to the spot where the trail left the
ridge to plunge down the steep slope on the
other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Patience whispered, suddenly
gripping her companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>As they listened, breathless, from somewhere
far below there came the deep, drawn-out
bay of a hound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed the mountain girl, pointing
to the ground. Where the trail left the
ridge, a fresh track had joined that of the
kidnappers. It was the trail of a man and
two huge dogs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hounds!&rdquo; whispered Patience. &ldquo;They
have hounds. Against these we have no
chance. They will smell us a long way off.
They will come after us. I can shoot but
one. The other&mdash;&rdquo; she paused to shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet we must go on! Think of little
Hallie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the brave mountain girl, &ldquo;we
must go on!&rdquo; Turning, she led the way
down the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />BY THE AID OF A COON</h2>
<p>Climbing up the mountain side without
making a sound had not been easy. Going
down it was doubly difficult. Now a rock,
slipping from a ledge at the side of the trail,
went crashing down through the sloping forest.
Now a pebble, rolling beneath Marion&rsquo;s
foot, sent her with a thud to the ground. And
now the dead branch of a tree, clung to for a
second&rsquo;s rest, gave way with a screaming
snap that must have been heard a mile away.</p>
<p>A half mile down the trail they came upon
a cabin. A mere shack built of logs with a
low chimney, with one door and no windows,
it could hardly be called a human habitation.</p>
<p>Yet there were people sleeping here, Marion
did not doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sha&mdash;shall we?&rdquo; she whispered as she
stood near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t do narry bit o&rsquo; good. No
&rsquo;count folks,&rdquo; whispered Patience.</p>
<p>They were about to pass on when the rattle
of a chain caused Marion to start and
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coon, pet coon,&rdquo; whispered the mountain
girl, pointing to a dark corner where a coon,
chained to a low shrub, was standing on his
haunches and eyeing them curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That coon,&rdquo; whispered Patience slowly,
&ldquo;might be some good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion did not see how it possibly could,
but she did not answer.</p>
<p>As they passed on down the trail Patience
paused often to study the hoof marks in the
soft earth. Once, at the juncture of a small
stream with the larger creek, she paused for
some time, only to shake her head and murmur:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they have gone on down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>At the next turn she paused again. This
time she did not go on, but, pointing up a
grass grown trail to the left, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone up to yonder clearin&rsquo;. Camp
there, I reckon. Wish we had that coon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What would we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Patience was already too far up the
new trail to catch Marion&rsquo;s whispered question.</p>
<p>As they rounded a clump of pawpaws
Patience whispered: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re camped up
yonder. I saw the light of their fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; whispered Marion. &ldquo;Perhaps
we can turn the tables and steal her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the hounds!&rdquo; said Patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, the hounds,&rdquo; Marion repeated
wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That coon, now,&rdquo; said Patience thoughtfully,
&ldquo;he might be a heap of help to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Marion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Patience did not reply. When she at last
spoke, it was to suggest that they make their
way up the far side of the slope that they
might be sure the ones they followed were
camping there. Wearily they followed the
creek and at last began the ascent.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken as they trudged
cautiously forward. Every care was taken
not to cause the least sound. Hounds, they
knew all too well, have sharp ears. So, darting
from bush to bush and from tree to tree,
they came at last to a spot directly over a
cliff where, by parting branches, they might
get a fair view of the deserted cabin and the
clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone there,&rdquo; whispered Marion. &ldquo;See!
There&rsquo;s a wisp of smoke curling from the
chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat silently intent.</p>
<p>Suddenly Marion&rsquo;s heart stopped beating!
Had she caught the low cry of a child? Yes,
there it was again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallie,&rdquo; she whispered, springing to her
feet. &ldquo;I must go to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Patience whispered tensely.
&ldquo;They are bad men. They would kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Hallie.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s heart was wrung
by the thought of the innocent child&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallie&rsquo;s all right for now. You have
heard her cry in that way often before. It&rsquo;s
just a fretful, sleepy cry. She will soon fall
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Even as they waited and listened
the crying ceased and over the hills and
the forest there fell the hush of night.</p>
<p>Into this hush Patience burst with an exceedingly
strange whispered remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had that coon. Marion, have
you any money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Good! They&rsquo;d sell it for that, I am
sure. But we won&rsquo;t ask them; just pin the
money to the coon&rsquo;s box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all we have. We will need food.
The kidnappers may go to the railroad. We
will need money. Anyway, why the coon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Patience did not answer. Snatching the
money, she was away in the night, leaving
Marion alone in the dark and with the
strange men scarcely more than a stone&rsquo;s
throw beneath her.</p>
<p>Who can tell what this city girl&rsquo;s thoughts
were as she sat there alone with the silence
of night hovering over her? Whatever the
thoughts might have been, they were at last
broken in upon by the low rattle of a chain.
Beside her stood Patience and in her arms,
cuddled up like a kitten, was the pet coon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what in the world did you do that
for?&rdquo; demanded Marion as, having picked
up Patience&rsquo;s long squirrel rifle, she came
trudging after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see!&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>Very weary and very skeptical, Marion
waited. Having once more reached the crest
of the cliff, Patience felt her way about until
she had located a tall young hickory tree with
branches some six feet from the ground.</p>
<p>Placing the coon on the ground and handing
the chain to Marion, she whispered: &ldquo;Give
me a lift to the first limb. Then hand me
the coon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Having complied with her request, Marion
leaned wearily upon the rifle while she listened
to the sound of her companion scaling
the tree, branch by branch.</p>
<p>Presently she heard Patience coming down.
When at last Patience caught the lowest
branch and swung herself down Marion saw
that her hands were empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo; Patience whispered hoarsely as
she dragged her companion through the
brush.</p>
<p>In silence they skirted the mountain side
until they were almost directly above the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist! Listen!&rdquo; Patience came to a
sudden standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; the other girl
breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sound a coon makes when he&rsquo;s
lonesome. But listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new and louder sound burst upon their
ears. There was no need for asking what
this was. Marion knew all too well. It was
the booming baying of a hound. The next
second he was joined by his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are they coming this way?&rdquo; asked Marion,
while a cold chill shook her from head
to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; There was a quiet assurance in
Patience&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made no sound. It
isn&rsquo;t us they hear. It&rsquo;s that coon. They&rsquo;ll
race over to that tree and bay up at it if the
men&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;em, and I think they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then they&rsquo;ll get on our scent and&mdash;and
it will all be over!&rdquo; Marion&rsquo;s teeth were
chattering in spite of her.</p>
<p>That this was a possibility she had not
thought of was told by the long moment
of silence before the mountain girl spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they might,&rdquo; she whispered, measuring
her words, &ldquo;but a hound&rsquo;s a hound, and
all hounds love to bay a coon tree. We&rsquo;ll
just have to wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Waiting out there in the dark forest with
every least sound, the flutter of a bird or
the movement of some small living thing in
the grass at their feet giving them a start,
was not the easiest thing in the world. Indeed,
Marion found it almost the hardest.</p>
<p>Now and again there came the call of the
coon, then the booming of the hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they let them go?&rdquo; Patience
murmured impatiently. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t; if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused in the midst of a sentence to
listen. Then in a joyous whisper she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There they go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. As Marion strained her ears
she caught the sound of the hounds tearing
away through the brush.</p>
<p>But even as she listened her heart suddenly
went wild. What if the hounds had somehow
gotten scent of them and were coming their
way? How terrible that would be! They
were sure to be great, gaunt, vicious beasts.</p>
<p>In the darkness it was impossible to tell
what direction they were taking. Aided by
her heightened imagination, she fancied the
sound of their rush through the bushes growing
louder, seemed to catch more plainly their
hoarse breathing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Wildly she strained her eyes in the dark,
searching for a tree that she might climb,
but in vain. The trees were either too large,
with branches twenty feet in air, or too slender
to bear her weight. In her wild terror she
was about to flee when again Patience whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Marion whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men. They are all alike&mdash;hounds and
mountain men. They can&rsquo;t stand the call of
a coon. Oh, thank God! Our chance is
coming. See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she looked toward the cabin Marion did
see. Not alone did she see the men, but saw
their faces plainly. By the glaring light of a
burning pine knot held aloft by one of the
men, faces of three tall, gaunt, stubby-whiskered
men were silhouetted against the shadows
of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Know them?&rdquo; Marion whispered as they
disappeared behind a clump of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Narry a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s all of them,&rdquo; Patience whispered
a moment later. &ldquo;Away, now, for little
Hallie. We&rsquo;ll have to take a chance. C&rsquo;mon,
and remember&mdash;not a sound. Not a snap of
a twig, not a breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment found them silently sliding
down the mountain. Now pausing, holding
their breath to listen, they caught the
roar of the hounds, the crash of the men
making their way through the brush. Now
they came to a dense thicket of briars that
tore at their clothes. Luckily they were clad
in suits of stout khaki. Now they plunged
down a deep ravine that threatened to be
their undoing. At last they were up the
other side and nearing the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to work fast!&rdquo; panted Patience.
&ldquo;Find&mdash;find her! Pick her up. Don&rsquo;t wake
her! Don&rsquo;t let her cry! Then go down the
mountain&mdash;fast&mdash;fast as we can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Then they caught sight of the dark bulk of
the cabin ahead of them. A faint light shone
in the open doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a light&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Marion, drawing her
companion back. &ldquo;Maybe a man has been
left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the fire on the hearth, I guess. Anyway,
we have to risk it. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they crept forward. Now they were
a hundred yards away, now fifty, now twenty-five,
and now, with hearts beating wildly,
they were skirting the cabin.</p>
<p>Dropping to the ground, Patience crept to
the doorway. One glance within and she
was up on hands and knees, creeping rapidly
forward.</p>
<p>One moment of tense silence and she appeared
at the door. In her arms was a large
bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&mdash;got her,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Now go!
Go fast! C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Once more they crept forward through the
dark. A moment passed, another, and yet
another. A hundred yards below the cabin
they were making rapid progress in spite of
fallen logs, brush and the dark, when Patience
suddenly stopped and gripped Marion&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hounds! They&rsquo;re baying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been baying for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s different now. They&rsquo;ve got our
scent. They&rsquo;re on our trail. C&rsquo;mon! We&rsquo;ve
got to go fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>What was happening during all this time
at the head of Laurel Branch beyond the
natural gateway? Had old Job and his followers
discovered that little Hallie had been
stolen? And were they hot on the trail of
the kidnappers? Would they arrive in time
to save the little captive and her brave deliverers?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>They had indeed discovered their loss and
were mourning it bitterly. As old Job sat
in the chimney corner reading his well worn
Bible, from time to time a tear fell upon the
faded pages. But the search had not begun;
might not begin for several days. Such are
the slow and silent ways of mountain folks.
Besides, no clew had been left for them to follow.
The kidnappers had entered the valley
on foot. Fortune had favored them. It was
during the excitement over the narrowly
averted raid by Ransom Turner&rsquo;s men that
they had slipped into the cabin and had carried
away the sleeping child.</p>
<p>On the rocky creek-bottom road the shoes
of the kidnappers made no imprint. It was
only after walking two miles that they
mounted horses, concealed all this time in
a paw-paw thicket, and rode away. No aid
could be expected from old Job&rsquo;s men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />A PERILOUS GLIDE</h2>
<p>As she dashed after her companion, Marion
felt a dizzy wave of faintness sweep over her.
With her knees all but refusing to support
her, she seemed in danger of plunging head
foremost down the mountain side. By a
supreme effort she regained control of herself
and, still gripping the long squirrel rifle,
followed on as best she could.</p>
<p>After stumbling through brush and over
logs, with the baying of hounds growing
louder in their ears, they came to the bed
of a small ravine. There was water here
and it offered better going. Besides, it
might throw the hounds off the trail. So,
sometimes to their ankles and sometimes to
their knees in water, they plunged forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the rifle dry,&rdquo; Patience panted back.
&ldquo;We may need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would&mdash;would you shoot?&rdquo; Marion
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot anything to save Hallie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child, now half awake, was crying
softly to herself.</p>
<p>Suddenly Patience came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Marion did listen, and what she heard
caused her to shrink back in fear. Above the
baying of the hounds and the shouts of men
who had doubtless discovered that Hallie was
gone, came the sound of water as it rushed
over the cliff to dash upon the rocks far
below. So near did it seem that Marion
shrank back in fear lest she be washed over
the precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blocked!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Patience, &ldquo;you take Hallie.
Give me the rifle. Now come on. It may
not be too late.&rdquo; She went scrambling up the
bank of the ravine. Twice she slipped and
seemed about to fall back, but each time
grasped the friendly branch of some shrub for
support. Many times she held out a helping
hand to the other less experienced climber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>At last with a deep breath, Patience leaped
upon the crest of the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The hounds!
They&rsquo;ve lost the scent. The water did that.
There&rsquo;s a chance yet. C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So weary were her limbs, so spent her
strength, that Marion felt she would rather
lie down and die than to go on, but the
thought of the innocent child she protected
gave her new strength. So down the other
side of the ridge they dashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping for better luck this time,&rdquo;
sighed Patience as she parted the bushes that
lined the next ravine. Hardly had she thrust
her right foot forward than she slipped, then
started gliding downward. Only a fortunate
grab at an overhanging bough saved her from
a fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Marion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a skidway for logs,&rdquo; whispered
Patience, struggling to regain her footing.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our chance. We&rsquo;ll have to be careful,
awful careful, but it will take us to the river.
Mebby down there in the bottoms there&rsquo;s
some one who&rsquo;ll help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a few well chosen words she explained
to her companion that when the white
wood timber had been cut down from the
mountains some years previous the woodsmen
had felled trees into the ravine and having
trimmed the branches from them had
formed of them a steep chute down which
thousands of logs had been sent gliding and
booming to the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slippery,&rdquo; the mountain girl warned,
&ldquo;but if we are careful we can make it. Hold
Hallie with one hand, hug the bank and cling
to branches with the other. I&rsquo;ll go before
you. If you slip I&rsquo;ll try to stop you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in silence, foot by foot, yard by yard,
rod by rod, they made their way down the
treacherous pathway. Now they came upon
a moss-grown portion that was safe as a
sidewalk, and now there lay before them the
shining whiteness of logs over which water
had run until they were smooth as polished
mahogany. Gliding, climbing, faltering, they
made their way downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; whispered Patience at last.
&ldquo;The hounds! They&rsquo;re on our trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then sudden disaster from a new field
threatened. At a slight bend in the ravine
they came upon a log chute. A great quantity
of debris&mdash;twigs, rotten limbs, leaves and
dead grass had collected in the chute and the
whole lay directly in the path. As they
climbed confidently upon it the whole mass
broke away and the next moment, like children
on a pillow in a play chute, they were
gliding downward.</p>
<p>Faster, faster, with fear tugging at their
hearts, they flew downward. With no power
to help themselves, dumb with apprehension
they sat there, sensing brush and trees rushing
past them, feeling the sharp cut of leaves
on their cheeks until Marion found her
tongue to scream:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, are we going into the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if nothing happens first,&rdquo; stammered
the mountain girl, for the first time truly
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Listen, Patience. We are older, we
can stand much. Hallie is a small child.
The cold of the river will kill her. Take off
your cape and make it into a ball. Try to
keep it dry. I&rsquo;ll do the best I can to protect
her. Somehow we&rsquo;ll make shore. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant her lips were sealed by the
sight that burst upon her startled eyes. Apparently
directly beneath them, its silently
sweeping waters yellow and swollen by recent
rains, lay the river and upon it, having
just emerged from behind a cloud, shone the
moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The perils that lay before the two girls
and their small charge, though great enough,
were not so imminent as they had appeared.
A sudden turn in the chute brought them
to a more gradual slope. When at last their
cushion of debris floated out upon the river,
so slight was the splash it made that it
seemed hard to believe that they had reached
the end of their perilous glide to safety. But
there was still danger, for all too soon their
frail raft was water-logged and sinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the cape,&rdquo; cautioned Marion
as, with her left hand holding little Hallie
tightly upon what was left of the raft, she
struck out into the dark, chilling waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&mdash;let&rsquo;s keep together,&rdquo; she called
through chattering teeth. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to
be hard, but we can make it. Let&mdash;let&rsquo;s try
for the other shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patience struck boldly out before her.</p>
<p>In spite of Marion&rsquo;s best efforts to protect
the child, she was getting wet. She began
to cry. The cry wrenched the older girl&rsquo;s
heart. &ldquo;If the water makes my teeth chatter,
what must it mean to her!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she called to Patience. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that off to the right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a log, a saw log. Ought we
try for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the course was changed. A moment
later they were clambering aboard a
great log of white wood that buoyed them up
as easily as a boat.</p>
<p>Sitting astride the log, Marion wrapped
Patience&rsquo;s warm dry cape about the child.
Hardly a moment had elapsed before her crying
ceased.</p>
<p>Of all the strange experiences that had
come to Marion, this was the most weird.
To have escaped from hounds and kidnappers
with a child, to have come gliding down
here in such a strange manner, to find herself
sitting astride a huge log surrounded by
black, rushing waters, and gliding steadily
forward to an unknown destination, this was
adventure of the most stirring kind. But
Marion found little enough time for such
reflections. Now that she had come to a
time of inaction she began to realize how cold
the water and night air were. She was seized
with such a fit of shivering that she feared
she would be shaken off the log.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wat&mdash;the water&rsquo;s better than this,&rdquo;
she chattered, yet for the sake of the peacefully
sleeping child she decided to endure
the torture as long as possible.</p>
<p>Trees and bushes along the river&rsquo;s bank
swept by. A dog at some cabin barked. Off
in the far distance a light flickered, then went
out. The cold was becoming easier to bear.
She was growing drowsy. She wanted to
sleep. Sleep&mdash;yes, that was what she needed.
Sleep, one wink of sleep. Her head fell upon
her breast. The cold was overcoming her, but
she did not realize it.</p>
<p>She dreamed she had left the log, to find a
roaring fire right by the river&rsquo;s bank, by
which she was warming herself. Suddenly a
jolt which almost threw her from the log
rudely brought her back to life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it!&rdquo; she exclaimed, gripping
Patience with one hand and clinging
frantically to the sleeping child with the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone aground,&rdquo; said Patience.
&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re careful we can get ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later, beside a clump of paw-paw
bushes, they were wringing the water
from their garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a light just over yonder,&rdquo; said
Patience. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better try to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very few steps and they were out of
the brush and on a well beaten road. A quarter
mile down this road they came suddenly
upon a broad clearing, in the midst of which
were three large white buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A school!&rdquo; exclaimed Marion. &ldquo;The
mission school! Oh, we are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, worn out as she was by
over-exertion, excitement and cold, she was
obliged to battle with an almost overwhelming
desire to drop in her tracks. Her splendid
will, however, stood her in good stead
and with a firm &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on,&rdquo; she led the
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE LAST OF HER CLAN</h2>
<p>There was a light in the lower right room
of the nearest building. Straight to the door
of this room they went and the next second
found them blinking at the light and at the
same time looking into one of the most
saintly faces they had ever seen, the motherly
face of Miss Bordell, who had for many years
devoted her life to the education of mountain
children.</p>
<p>The girls quickly told their story. Almost
before they knew it, having been assured that
here they would be quite safe from any intruders,
they found themselves tucked in between
a pair of white sheets with Hallie
sleeping peacefully between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe,&rdquo; Marion whispered to herself,
&ldquo;but the mystery is not solved. To-morrow&mdash;to-mor&mdash;&rdquo;
Her thoughts were never finished.
Her weary brain had closed shop for
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most unusual thing I have ever
heard of,&rdquo; said the school principal after she
had heard the girls&rsquo; story the next morning.
&ldquo;You say they were regular mountain
folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Patience nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it so unusual,&rdquo; said
the elderly lady, wrinkling her brow. &ldquo;Mountain
folks aren&rsquo;t given to stealing and kidnapping.
That sort of crime seems almost foreign
to their nature. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we
will do. The Circuit Judge, John Bascomb,
happens to be down at the village. We&rsquo;ll go
down and talk it over with him. It&rsquo;s only a
mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So down the road to the village they
marched, Marion, Patience, little Hallie, and
their benefactress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>They had reached the first cabin that stood
by the creek road when of a sudden Patience,
pulling excitedly at the principal&rsquo;s sleeve,
whispered hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them there! They&rsquo;re the three
men that carried Hallie away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A single glance told Marion she was right.
So great was her fear of them that her first
impulse was to snatch up Hallie and flee. But
her better judgment prevailed. Surely here
they were safe.</p>
<p>The men, apparently without having seen
them, turned up a side path to enter a cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure those are the men?&rdquo; asked
the principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; the girls answered in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time later they were telling their
story to Judge Bascomb, a kindly old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing,&rdquo; he said after they had finished,
&ldquo;is to find out who the men are.
Come on out and show me the cabin they
entered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he mused as he sighted the cabin.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be Long Jim. That&rsquo;s his cabin. He&rsquo;s
laid up with rheumatism. Must be some of
his friends. Here, John Henry,&rdquo; he called to
a barefoot boy. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s visiting at Long
Jim&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon hit&rsquo;s Black John Berkhart and his
brother, Blinkie Bill, and mebby Hog Farley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;I know &rsquo;em.
We&rsquo;ll just step over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Marion, hanging back. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, little girl,&rdquo; the judge reassured
her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just plain mountain
folks. I can&rsquo;t understand their actions of
yesterday, but that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going over
there to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men in the cabin appeared a little
startled at sight of the judge and the girls,
but having motioned them to seats around
the crude fireplace, they sat there in stoical
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Black John,&rdquo; said the judge in a friendly
tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told you took this little girl from
her home yesterday and carried her away
over the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;low you&rsquo;re right informed, Jedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that&rsquo;s kidnapping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kin name it, Jedge. I ain&rsquo;t much on
larnin&rsquo; nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jedge, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; the black-eyed
mountaineer settled himself to explain. &ldquo;That
little gal there is the last of her clan, the
Cawoods, the fightenest clan that I reckon
ever lived in these here mountings. They
fit us and we fit them, and I reckon, Jedge,
if&rsquo;n ther&rsquo;d been more Cawoods and less Berkharts
there wouldn&rsquo;t been any Berkharts left,
same&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s only one Cawood left, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
little Hallie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jedge,&rdquo; the mountain man paused to stare
moodily at the fire, &ldquo;us folks is plum tired
fightin&rsquo;. &rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no satisfaction to go out a
hoein&rsquo; corn an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; crops on these here
rocky hillsides when you know like as not
some feller&rsquo;s lying up there in the bresh above
you waitin&rsquo; for to put daylight through you.
And Jedge, long&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a Cawood a-livin&rsquo;
in these here mountings, even a little one
like Hallie, there&rsquo;s some one goin&rsquo; to rise up
to shoot and kill us. So, Jedge, we took her
an&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jedge,&rdquo; he protested as he saw the
look of horror on the faces about him, &ldquo;we
didn&rsquo;t aim to kill her. Reckon there ain&rsquo;t
no mounting folk anywhar mean as that.
But, Jedge, out of the mountings thar&rsquo;s places
I&rsquo;ve heard tell of, big places whar they keep
orphans. Hallie bein&rsquo; a true orphan, we
&rsquo;lowed we&rsquo;d jest take her out thar and give
her another name. She&rsquo;d grow up and never
know she was a Cawood, and not nobody
else&rsquo;d know, either, and then thar&rsquo;d be peace
in these here mountings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, then the
judge spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Black John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t make
right by doing a wrong. Hallie was not kin
to you. You had no right to lay one finger
upon her. You believe in God, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
The mountaineer dropped his head. &ldquo;God
never told you that men would be raised up
to kill your people for Hallie&rsquo;s sake. It was
the powers of evil and darkness that told you
that. It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for this crime you have committed,&rdquo;
he said in a stern voice, &ldquo;you are accountable
to the law. You should perhaps be bound
over to the grand jury, but you did the thing
in ignorance&mdash;your motives were not criminal
motives. If those who were wronged are disposed
to forgive you, and if you give me your
word of honor that you will never molest
the child again, I&rsquo;ll do my best to see that
you go free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Patience and Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing else I want to know,&rdquo; said
Marion, her voice husky with emotion as she
turned to face Black John. &ldquo;Why did you
seize my friend at the back of Pine Mountain
and hold her against her will?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That, Jedge,&rdquo; said the mountain man,
talking to the judge instead of Marion, &ldquo;was
part and parcel of the same plan. Little Hallie
were a stayin&rsquo; at their cabin then and we
thought quite natural we might trade the
older girl fer the leetle one that wasn&rsquo;t only
just a mounting girl noways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge looked at Marion as much as to
say: &ldquo;That is explained. Shall we hold
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion frowned. She knew mountain
ways and mountain courts, knew how seldom
justice was done. She recalled a word Ransom
Turner had let fall. &ldquo;Reckon a word
of honor given by a mountain man&rsquo;s a heap
site surer than a jury trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take his word, if he gives it freely,&rdquo;
Marion said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black John, do we have your word of
honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jedge, hit&rsquo;s mighty hard to see through;
plumb hard, but I reckon hit&rsquo;s right. I give
my word, Jedge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>The judge bowed. Then, followed by the
judge, they all filed out of the cabin.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, in her room at the whipsawed
cabin, with great events hanging in the
air all about her, Marion closed her weary
eyes for a few winks of sleep. Little Hallie
slept peacefully beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THE STRANGE PROCESSION</h2>
<p>When Florence awoke next morning at
dawn she stared wildly about her for an instant,
then settled back luxuriously among
the covers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Back at the
whipsawed cabin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay there gazing dreamily at the time
browned ceiling. Suddenly her gaze fell upon
the misplaced board that covered the opening
leading to the attic.</p>
<p>At once her mind was filled with all manner
of wild speculations. Had Marion, in
her absence, thought of some new hiding
place in that attic? Had she found the Confederate
gold? Or had Uncle Billie talked
too much about the vanished gold? Had
some one, with no legal right to the gold,
come to the house while everyone was away?
Had he climbed to the attic and plundered it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>She found herself all but overcome by a
desire to climb up there and look for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this day,&rdquo; she said, sitting up wide
awake, &ldquo;this day I have no time for treasure
hunting. My business to-day is that of
being tried by a jury. And after that,&rdquo;&mdash;her
thoughts were bitter,&mdash;&ldquo;after that it is to be
my duty to show these mountain folks how
gamely a girl from the outside can lose an
election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this moment there
passed through her mind moving pictures of
her experience at the back of Pine Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deed for Caleb Powell&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;I wonder when they will have
it? Will they have it at all? Will we get
our commission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; she exclaimed, leaping out of
bed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no time for such speculation
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>The trial was on. The house was packed.
Lacking a town hall, the Justice had selected
the schoolhouse for court room.</p>
<p>To Florence the thing was tragic. To be
tried by a jury, a jury of men who two
months before were utterly unknown to her;
to be tried by a people whose children she
had been helping to educate, this was tragic
indeed. There were faces in the audience
which seemed to reflect the tragedy; seamed
faces, old before their time; faces of women
who had toiled beyond their just lot that their
children might have just a little more than
they had enjoyed.</p>
<p>There was humor in the situation, too. To
be sitting there in the very chair which she
had been accustomed to use in her school-work;
to be looking into the faces of scores
of children, yet instead of directing their
work to be listening to the Justice stumbling
over the words of the warrant, all this struck
her as decidedly odd, a thing to smile about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Ransom, too, must have seen the humor of
it, for as Florence looked his way she surprised
a smile lurking around the corners of
his mouth.</p>
<p>The jury was called. Florence, studying
their faces as they came shambling forward,
was surprised and relieved to find there not a
single man who was hostile to her; not one
of Black Blevens&rsquo; men was on that jury. She
caught her breath as the true meaning of it
came to her. George Sergeant, the deputy,
was her friend. He had seen to it that she
had the proper sort of a jury. A lump came
into her throat. It is good, at such a time
as this, to know that one has friends. The
very fact that she had demanded a jury trial
had perhaps saved the day for her.</p>
<p>The details of the case arranged, a lawyer
arose to open the case. It was Florence&rsquo;s
lawyer, provided not by herself, but by Ransom
Turner and his men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>It was a beautiful and wonderful speech
that the young lawyer made. A product of
the mountain, born and raised far up in the
hills, he had been helped to his earlier education
by just such a school as the girls had
been teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An outrage! A shame and a blight to
Laurel Creek&rsquo;s good name!&rdquo; he exclaimed
eloquently. &ldquo;You all know what these summer
schools have meant to us and to our
children. Good hearted, generous people of
education and refinement come to our mountains
to help our children, and how do we
repay them? Arrest them for carrying concealed
weapons! Arrest a woman for that!
And what was it that this lady did? She put
a twenty-two pistol in her pocket after she
failed to shoot a squirrel. A pistol, did I say?
Really a little rifle. A long barrel and a
handle. Attach a stock to it and it&rsquo;s a rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concealed weapons!&rdquo; his voice was filled
with scorn. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t kill a man with
that! A twenty-two! Concealed weapons!
If I were to search this crowd to-day I could
find a hundred deadlier weapons on the persons
who sit before me!&rdquo; There was a sudden
shuffling of the uneasy feet of startled
mountaineers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Concealed weapons!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
a more deadly one in my own pocket!&rdquo; He
drew a large clasp knife from his pocket and
opened it. &ldquo;I could kill you quicker with
that than with a twenty-two.&rdquo; He put the
knife back in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet we arrest a woman, a girl really,
who has come among us to help us. As a
reward we arrest her! Will you honorable
jurymen place a blight on the name of such
a one by saying she is guilty of a crime?
Something tells me you will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the young lawyer sat down there was
a stir in the room, a whispering that came
near to applause, but the bronze faces of the
jurymen never changed. Nor had they
changed when, after hearing the Justice give
his reasons why the girl should be found
guilty, they left the room to retire to the
shade of a distant beach tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>It was a tense situation that followed.
There was no conversation. To many in the
room a sentence of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; would mean the
end of their hopes of a winter school worthy
of the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can beat old Black Blevens in
this trial,&rdquo; Ransom Turner was whispering
to his henchmen. &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s likely there&rsquo;s men
who&rsquo;ll vote right in the school election this
afternoon. It&rsquo;s a chance, though. It&rsquo;s a
plumb uncertain one. Can&rsquo;t tell next to
nothin&rsquo; what men&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, while the distant mumble of the jurymen
floated indistinct through the windows,
they waited and whispered among themselves.</p>
<p>A moment passed, two, three, four. Then
the jurors came marching back.</p>
<p>In the midst of a silence that could be felt,
the jurymen took their seats and the Justice
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, what is your verdict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jedge,&rdquo; said a tall, lanky woodsman, rising
to his feet, &ldquo;we came to the conclusion that
there weren&rsquo;t no deadly weapons packed,
not narry one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>There followed ten seconds more of silence,
then came a rush forward to shake the young
teacher&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>In spite of her efforts at self control, Florence
felt tears splash upon her hands, nor
were hers the only tears shed that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must be strong,&rdquo; she told herself,
setting her lips tight. &ldquo;The day is but begun.
This is the day of the election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time for the election came.</p>
<p>Marion, having finished her short sleep
and eaten a hearty dinner, was on hand as
fresh and young as if she had not passed
through the terrors of the previous night.</p>
<p>To the two girls, born and bred on the
plains, the election, which had reached a high
pitch of excitement by early afternoon, was
indeed a revelation. There were judges of
that election who served without pay, twenty
or more of them, not legal judges but men
who were there to see that their side had fair
play. Ten or more of Black Bleven&rsquo;s men
were constantly present; an equal number of
the Ransom Turner clan were there. Not
a word was said by any of them, but everyone
knew that guns, not lips, would speak if
things went wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>These men meant to see that the men of
their side were permitted to vote and if
trouble arose they were ready to fight.</p>
<p>All that quiet afternoon, as if before a
storm, the air seemed electrified. In every
heart deep feelings surged; hatred in some,
loyalty in others. To every thinking man the
situation held dire possibilities. Here might
start a bloody feud that would not end until
scores were in their graves.</p>
<p>Men and women stood in little knots.
Questions were asked in whispers. Would
they vote? Would some of Black Blevens&rsquo;
men dare to cross his will? Would they dare?
Black Blevens had large logging contracts.
He would hire many men during the coming
winter. Dared the men, whose very bread
and butter depended upon him, desert him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the question was beginning
to be answered. The election appeared clearly
lost for Ransom Turner. At three-thirty
he was eleven votes behind, and no apparent
chance of a rally.</p>
<p>Florence stuck grimly to her post, close
to the schoolhouse door. Her heart was
breaking. She loved the mountain children,
had dreamed of a bigger and better school
than Laurel Branch had ever known. That
was all passing now. In two or three weeks
she would be bidding the valley farewell
forever. Yet, with the grim determination
of a Spartan, she stuck to her post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>As for Marion, she had learned what
seemed to her to be one of the secrets of
happiness. When one&rsquo;s greatest hope seems
about to fail, it is well to quickly swing one&rsquo;s
interests to others, less important perhaps,
but not less entrancing. As the election appeared
lost, she thought once more of the
Georgia gold and the attic of the whipsawed
house. She it had been who had removed
the board from the ceiling. At that time,
however, she had been suddenly called to
other tasks and, having replaced the board
wrong end to, had left without climbing to
the attic at all. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time enough now,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;and who knows what I might
discover? There&rsquo;s no need to stay here any
longer. The election is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching her room, she at once shoved the
bed beneath the loose board, and a moment
later, candle in hand, found herself swinging
along from beam to beam toward the ancient
pounding mill in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; she murmured
to herself. &ldquo;Cumbersome old thing. No
good up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out her hand to touch it. Then
she took it away in disgust. It was black
with three decades of accumulated dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she grunted. &ldquo;Wonder if I could
tip it over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried, and failed to move it,&mdash;tried once
more and failed. Then she looked about her
for some sort of a pry. Having secured a
loose board, she attacked the task once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>This time she was more successful. With
a thump that shook the solid old frame from
sill to rafter, the cumberstone block rolled
over on its side.</p>
<p>As it fell the girl&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat.
What was that she heard? Could it have
been a metallic clinking? Had her ears deceived
her? She hoped not. But if she had
heard aright, from whence had it come?
From some dark corner among the rafters,
or from within the very heart of the old
pounding mill?</p>
<p>At that moment there came to her ears
the sound of hoarse shouting. What did it
mean? Was there to be trouble? Would
there be shots? Would women be fleeing,
men dying?</p>
<p>None of these. A strange and stirring
scene was being enacted at the schoolhouse
at the mouth of Laurel Branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>A short time after Marion left the school
building, as Florence stood looking away at
the lovely blue of the hills and trying in
vain to tell it all an affectionate goodbye, she
heard someone exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a&rsquo;yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s them quare folks from up yonder
beyond the stone gateway,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>At once the girl found herself staring in
wonder at a strange procession moving slowly
down the road. A score of mountain men
and women, some on horseback, most on foot,
led by a one-armed giant and a boy with an
arm in a sling, were advancing on the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud Wax!&rdquo; the girl breathed. &ldquo;Bud,
and the folks from beyond the gates. What
can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distance was short. She soon knew.
As the giant&rsquo;s huge form darkened the
schoolhouse door his deep voice rumbled a
question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Lection goin&rsquo; on here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came no answer from the surprised
onlookers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll vote,&rdquo; said the giant.</p>
<p>At this move, every man of the watchers
grew rigid. Whose man was this? Many
a hand shifted to a pistol grip. The election
hung in the balance. As this man voted, so
would all that motley throng. There was
no questioning their right. They lived within
the district. Their votes could be sworn
in. How would they vote? They had come
with Bud Wax. That looked bad for Ransom
Turner&rsquo;s clan. But there had been strange
whisperings about Bud. He had been heard
to say things about the teachers from the outside
that were far from unkind. Could it be
that, having been fairly conquered by one of
these, he had learned a respect for them that
he had felt for no other one?</p>
<p>As for Florence, her heart was in her
mouth. Would they do it? Could they crush
her hopes after she had done so much for
little Hallie? They might. There was no
accounting for the ways of these strange
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>There was a hush of silence as the giant,
having given his name and sworn in his vote,
seized the ballot and made his mark.</p>
<p>Out of the silence there came a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s for Ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the silence was shattered
by a round of hoarse shouts. The
election was won by Ransom Turner. The
people from &ldquo;up yonder&rdquo; had turned the
balance.</p>
<p>As for Florence, it was too much for her
overwrought nerves. Dashing away into a
thicket, she threw herself flat upon the ground
to give vent to violent sobs.</p>
<p>A half hour later the two young teachers,
each hurrying toward the other, met half
way between the whipsawed house and the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence! I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; Marion
exclaimed.</p>
<p>And Florence at the same instant cried,
&ldquo;Marion, we won! We won!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>Throwing themselves into each others arms,
they laughed and cried together. After that
they sat side by side on a log and calmly
told their stories.</p>
<p>To Florence, the thrilling climax of the
election had been a revelation. Bud Wax
had provided the great surprise. Won over
by who knows what course of reasoning, he
had taken the side of his teachers. Having
seen Florence entering the forbidden gateway,
he had followed as her protector. While playing
this role, he had broken his arm. He had
spent the past few days convincing those
strange people &ldquo;up yonder&rdquo; that it was their
duty to come down to the mouth of the creek
and vote in the school election. Convinced
by his argument, and Florence&rsquo;s watchful care
over Hallie, they had consented to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just when we thought all was lost,&rdquo;
Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;here they came, everyone
of them, to vote for Ransom Turner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she hurried on, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve decided
that the folks at the mouth of the creek
are not such bad neighbors after all. They&rsquo;re
going to send their children down to our
school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence!&rdquo; Marion clasped her hands
in an ecstasy of joy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be such a
school! A real new school building with two
rooms, new seats and stoves and everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the heart of the pounding mill.
I tipped it over, and it sort of clinked. I
thumped it here and there until I found that
the hole where they pounded the corn had a
false bottom. I pried it up and there was the
gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confederate gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not Confederate gold, but Georgia
and Carolina gold. There never was any
Confederate gold. None ever was coined.
I received a letter about that from the museum
this morning. The Confederate States
coined a few silver half-dollars. All the rest
of their money was paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>For a moment the two girls sat in silent
contemplation of their great good fortune and
the joyous future that lay before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t such a lot of gold,&rdquo; Marion
said at last. &ldquo;Forty or fifty pieces, that&rsquo;s
all, but each piece is worth several times its
value in gold, so there will be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; murmured Florence contentedly.
&ldquo;And we shall have a school!
Such a school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolhouse was yet to be built. That
this might be accomplished, grateful mountaineers
sent their teams over the mountains
for windows, doors, seats and hardware,
while others, manning a small sawmill, got
out the lumber. When the time came for
beginning the construction, there was a
&ldquo;workin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mountain folks came for miles
around; men with hammers, axes and saws,
women with pots and pans and all manner
of good things to eat. Men worked, women
cooked. They made a holiday of it, and before
the sun went down that day the two
room school building was two-thirds done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s the way us mounting folks be,&rdquo; said
old Uncle Billie, rubbing his hands together.
&ldquo;If&rsquo;n we all likes you we likes you a right
smart, an&rsquo; if&rsquo;n we all don&rsquo;t take to you, we
can be meaner&rsquo;n pisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school was a success in every way.
Long before the term came to an end Laurel
Branch was looking forward to better things.</p>
<p>One day two months after the school began,
Florence received a letter from Mr.
Dobson, the coal man. With trembling fingers
she tore it open. A small bit of paper
fell out. Snatching it up, she read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay to the order.... Nineteen hundred
and sixty dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Marion! Marion!&rdquo; she fairly screamed.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our commission!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That money,&rdquo; said Mrs. McAlpin, as they
sat in fireside council that night, &ldquo;is your
own. You earned it fairly. It is no longer
needed for the school. If you feel you must
give some, give a tenth of it to the school.
It is your duty to use the remainder in completing
your own education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was some time before the two girls
could be brought to see the matter in this
light. Perhaps they feared life would lose
its thrill if they were no longer dependent
upon their muscles and their wits for their
living. In the end they yielded. When, after
finishing the winter school, they left the
mountains for the University, it was with
a full purse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>Florence found that the possession of
money did not necessarily rob one of the
thrills that life should have. Had she not
been free to wander about the city she would
not have wandered into a curious place back
of the Ghetto at 777 Monroe Street. Had she
not been possessed of an unusual amount of
cash, she would not have made an extraordinary
purchase there, and having missed the
purchase, would have lost an unusually romantic
and mysterious adventure as well.
But she did make the purchase and the adventure
came&mdash;but the story is a long one
and will be found in our next book entitled
&ldquo;The Thirteenth Ring.&rdquo;</p>
